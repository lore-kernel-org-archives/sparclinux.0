Hi Jan,

Thanks for the answers.

I assumed that from the "NO-CARRIER" status, but I had to check: for
all I know it's some sort of failover connection and is hooked up to a
disabled port on a different switch.

True that. I have an overabundance of PCI network cards and have built
temporary servers with two of them bridged together so I'm not
stealing a port that might be needed.

Makes sense.

Ok, I'm guessing that this is production so heavy debugging isn't
going to happen.

I'm out of ideas. Tag?
