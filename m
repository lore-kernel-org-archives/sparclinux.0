Subject: [PATCHSET 0-5] remove unneeded nfsd #includes

Some arch files had unneeded #includes directives from linux/nfsd/*.
Some vfs files had unneeded #includes directives from linux/nfsd/*.

In an effort to move some of the now public nfsd headers to the source
directory, submitted a cleanup.

I have cross compiled sparc64 and s390, parsic needs testing. Please ARCH
people sends ACKs, or take these patches through your trees.

patches:
[PATCH 1/5] parsic: remove unused nfsd #includes
	Some kind soul, please compile with this patch? compile
	is all that's needed.

[PATCH 2/5] sparc: remove unused nfsd #includes
[PATCH 3/5] s390: remove unused nfsd #includes
	These two were cross compiled. Should we submit them through
	nfsd tree or the ARCH trees?

[PATCH 4/5] vfs: nfsctl.c unused nfsd #includes
[PATCH 5/5] lockd: Remove unused nfsd headers #includes
	Can these patches go through the nfsd tree?
	Who's ACKs should we collect? Andrew?

Bruce Hi
With this set applied, the only nfsd files used publicly are:
	const.h	export.h nfsfh.h stats.h syscall.h

These files can be moved to source folder:
	cache.h  debug.h  nfsd.h  state.h xdr3.h  xdr4.h  xdr.h

Why is debug.h exported from Kernel? (include/linux/nfsd/Kbuild)

So just to see how this move might look like see last patch:
[RFC] nfsd: Move private headers to source directory
	This patch was compiled, as well, on x86(32/64), sparc64, s390

Thanks
Boaz
