No, there is only one address that points to the kernel.
As we have no kernel ASLR yet, and the kernel mapping is 
a 1:1 mapping from 0 to memory end and the kernel is only
from _stext to _etext. The vmalloc area contains modules
and vmalloc but not a 2nd kernel mapping.

But thanks for your example, now I understood. If we have only
one address 
>>> +     if (overlaps(ptr, n, textlow, texthigh))

This is just enough.

So what about for the CONFIG text:

       An architecture should select this if the kernel mapping has a secondary
       linear mapping of the kernel text - in other words more than one virtual
       kernel address that points to the kernel image. This is used to verify 
       that kernel text exposures are not visible under CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY.

Can this be resolved on all platforms at compile time?
