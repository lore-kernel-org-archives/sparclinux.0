Really?  How do you know this, our test-build infrastructure is really
good, what has rotted with it?

And again, pick a column width and stick with it in the whole
changelog...

That's horrid kernel code, and shouldn't be an example of anything other
than what NOT to do.  You know better than this, put the #ifdef in a .h
file.

Yes, and what's wrong with that?

You do know about COMPILE_TEST, right?  What's wrong with that?  Why not
use that as-is today and not add a new configuration option?

Ok, you are talking about majorly changing how the kernel build system
works.  What do the kbuild developers/maintainers say about this?

Pleaase use COMPILE_TEST here, we've already marked almost all drivers
with it today.  We also have really good build tools, including cross
compilers that you can use to test-build stuff on all different arches
if you feel you are somehow not building things you need to test-build.

I fail to see how this is going to do anything different from what we
have today, so why add it and have to maintain it?  Have you enabled it
on subsystems that currently do not get properly build tested and found
any issues?  What subsystems were they and why are they not in our
current build tests?

thanks,
