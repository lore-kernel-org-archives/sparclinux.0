Yes, that is what I expected to see in libsanitizer, I just couldn't
find any code that actually does this check.

Yes, of course. In fact, I see multiple possible problems that

- kernel reading uninitialized data if 'FD_ZERO()' was
  used with a shorter size than the count argument.
- kernel writing beyond the fd_set data on stack
  when the declaration had a shorter size than the count
  argument.

Each one could happen either because __FD_SETSIZE
is smaller than 'count', or because kernel and user space
disagree on the element size (32 vs 64 bit on x32).

Sorry, I meant [1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10245053/

Ok, so not '__fds_bits'.

Is '__kernel_fds_bits' ok? I would prefer to keep at least the
name __kernel_ namespace that we have for typedefs and the
occasional struct tag.
