Ok, I see. Thanks for the explanation!

I fear we have considered linux/posix_types.h to be something that
can be included anywhere for a long time, so it may be better to
ensure that this is actually the case, and avoid the problem with those
two structures but leave the rest untouched.

I think we can move  __kernel_fsid_t into include/uapi/asm-generic/statfs.h,
which is the only thing that needs it anyway. We have two definitions of
it today, the non-generic one being for mips32, but incidentally there was
a patch the other day to remove that and use the generic one instead.

With that done, we can change asm/socket.h to just use asm/posix_types.h.

I would still prefer to solve the problem for linux/posix_types.h as well,
but I'm not sure even how __kernel_fd_set  is used today in
user space, if at all. Commit 8ded2bbc1845 ("posix_types.h: Cleanup
stale __NFDBITS and related definitions") removed most of the fd_set
definition after a long discussion [1], and since then it has been
basically impossible to use 'struct fd_set'  from the kernel in a
meaningful way without including the libc headers or duplicating
them.

Should we just remove __kernel_fd_set from the exported headers and
define the internal fd_set directly in include/linux/types.h? (Adding the
folks from the old thread to Cc).
