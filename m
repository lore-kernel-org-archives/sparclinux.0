Hi

Here I'm sending 10 patches to inline various functions.

To give you some understanding of sparc64, every function there uses big 
stack frame (at least 192 bytes). 128 bytes are required by architecture 
(16 64-bit registers), 48 bytes are there due to mistake of Sparc64 ABI 
designers (calling function has to allocate 48 bytes for called function) 
and 16 bytes are some dubious padding.

So, on sparc64, if you have a simple function that passes arguments to 
other function it still takes 192 byte --- regardless of how simple the 
function is. Tail-call may be used, but it is disabled in kernel if 
debugging is enabled (Makefile: ifdef CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
KBUILD_CFLAGS += -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-optimize-sibling-calls).

The stack trace has 75 nested functions, that totals to at least 14400 
bytes --- and it kills the 16k stack space on sparc. In the stack trace, 
there are many function which do nothing but pass parameters to other 
function. In this series of patches, I found 10 such functions and turned 
them to inlines, saving 1920 bytes. Especially waking wait queue is bad, 
it calls 8 nested functions, 7 of which do nothing. I turned 5 of them to 
inline.

I'll post those 10 patches in next emails.

Some of the patches fix cases that could be optimized with tail-calling. 
If you want to drop the patches, you should enable tail-calling by 
removing -fno-optimize-sibling-calls from Makefile (it makes debugging a 
bit harder).
