Not sure I understand. Something like?
addr = mmap(VM_FAULTPOPULATE) # To prevent speculative mappings into the vma
[...]
mlock(addr, len) # Now I want the full mlock semantic

and the later to have the full mlock semantic and populate the given
area regardless of VM_FAULTPOPULATE being set on the vma? This would
be an interesting question because mlock man page clearly states the
semantic and that is to _always_ populate or fail. So I originally
thought that it would obey VM_FAULTPOPULATE but this needs a more
thinking.

This is really confusing. Let me try to rephrase that. So you have
mlock(addr, len, MLOCK_ONFAULT)
munlock(addr, len, MLOCK_LOCKED)

IIUC you would expect the vma still being MLOCK_ONFAULT, right? Isn't
that behavior strange and unexpected? First of all, munlock has
traditionally dropped the lock on the address range (e.g. what should
happen if you did plain old munlock(addr, len)). But even without
that. You are trying to unlock something that hasn't been locked the
same way. So I would expect -EINVAL at least, if the two modes should be
really represented by different flags.

Or did you mean the both types of lock like:
mlock(addr, len, MLOCK_ONFAULT) | mmap(MAP_LOCKONFAULT)
mlock(addr, len, MLOCK_LOCKED)
munlock(addr, len, MLOCK_LOCKED)

and that should keep MLOCK_ONFAULT?
This sounds even more weird to me because that means that the vma in
question would be locked by two different mechanisms. MLOCK_LOCKED with
the "always populate" semantic would rule out MLOCK_ONFAULT so what
would be the meaning of the other flag then? Also what should regular
munlock(addr, len) without flags unlock? Both?

This sounds like the proper behavior to me. munlock should simply always
drop VM_LOCKED and the VM_FAULTPOPULATE can live its separate life.

Btw. could you be more specific about semantic of m{un}lock(addr, len, flags)
you want to propose? The more I think about that the more I am unclear
about it, especially munlock behavior and possible flags.
