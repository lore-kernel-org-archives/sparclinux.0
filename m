On the arch I hit this on (which isn't in tree) I experienced a fault at th=
e=20
point of the unaligned write in kernel code, but this is only because=20
unaligned access checking is switched on which isn't always possible=20
(otherwise the write would have just silently failed/done something else). =
It=20
terminated the program, but didn't cause any other problems.
Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt also mentions that some=20
architectures raise exceptions that can't be worked around, or fail silentl=
y=20
and may actually perform different writes to the one requested.

The common way to access the framebuffer is by mmapping it into userland, s=
o I=20
don't think the read/write syscalls are commonly used on it, and in any cas=
e=20
colour data tends to be naturally aligned so unaligned writes would be=20
uncommon.

The actualy case that hit this is admitedly rather silly. I did a quick tes=
t=20
of the framebuffer by typing this at a shell:
yes > /dev/fb0
I'd have to check it again to see exactly how lots of 2 byte writes ("y\n")=
=20
ended up unaligned, but at the point of the crash the dest pointer was=20
definitely unaligned (the hex address ended in a 5) and the patch fixed it =
for=20
me.

Hope that helps.

Cheers
