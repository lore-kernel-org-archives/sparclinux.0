Perhaps the least inaccurate form of this might be:


Inspired by atomic protections in PaX/grsecurity.

As this is something I'd suggested we implement based on the work in
PaX/grsecurity, David took the first (and continuing) stab at
conversions, Hans did more, and Elena has been doing even more along
with the heavy-lifting of keeping the series organized. That way the
first SoB is still the author, the last SoB is still the email sender,
and everyone's name is mentioned.

Or just:


Inspired by atomic protections in PaX/grsecurity, based on work from
David Windsor, Hans Liljestrand, and myself.

I'm not picky -- I just want to see the conversion to refcount_t
happen, and everyone in Elena's SoB list has done work on it...
