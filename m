So Andrew's first hunch that interrupts were somehow involved is right.

Yeah, that has me baffled too. Still, the fact is that I can only trigger the bug by loading sym53c8xx before sungem. I have yet to find any other conditions that trigger it. Loading sungem before sym53c8xx on an affected kernel gives no trouble at all.
