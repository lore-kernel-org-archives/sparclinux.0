zone_spanned_pages_in_node does chech the zone boundaries are within the
node boundaries. But that doesn't really tell anything about other
potential zones interleaving with the physical memory range.
zone->spanned_pages simply gives the physical range for the zone
including holes. Interleaving nodes are essentially a hole
(__absent_pages_in_range is going to skip those).

That means that when free_area_init_core simply goes over the whole
physical zone range including holes and that is why we need to check
both for physical and logical holes (aka other nodes).

The life would be so much easier if the whole thing would simply iterate
over memblocks...
