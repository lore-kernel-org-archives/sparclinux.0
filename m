This may be true for the m68k example, and traditionally for all
PCI hosts, but as we move to a more modular architecture with
drivers/pci/hosts, you can have PCI host drivers that are loadable
modules and get loaded after the built-in drivers are initialized,
or you can have host drivers that depend on a resource (clock,
regulator, reset, gpio, ...) that in turn comes from a driver
that gets initialized later.
