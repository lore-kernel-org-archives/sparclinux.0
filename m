We have

Well, the SOB chain should reflect who handled the patch on its way from
the original author to the upstream committer. If you want to express
who contributed, you can use Originally-by, Suggested-by, ...

You could also have free text in the commit message:

"People who contributed to this: ..."

In any case, it is all in Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.
Have a look.

There's sed/awk/perl/python/bash... whatever tools that can do the
proper conversions with.

Good mailing practices for 400: avoid top-posting and trim the reply.
