Moreover, the size argument seems wrong here.
hmm, I'm actually not sure yet, what the correct size really would be,
where the value actually comes from. Just assumed that it would be the
whole area that the BAR tells. But now I recognized that I'd need to
substract 'offset' here.

Rethinking it further, we'd probably could deduce the UPIO_* from the
struct resource, too.

avoid such splitting, first parameter is quite fit above line.

Ok. My intention was having both parameters starting at the same line,
but then the second line would get too long again. > ...and here, and

the reason what I've just replaced the exactly the assignments, trying
not to touch too much ;-)
I'll have a closer look on what can be moved w/o side effects.

Ok.

Ok. fixed it.

hmm, lacking creativity here ;-)
any suggestions ?

It's not an error, but desired behaviour: NULL resource
clears the value.

It's the default case. The special cases (eg. UPIO_MEM32) need to be
set explicitly, after that call.

Not really nice, but haven't found a better solution yet. I don't like
the idea of passing an UPIO_* parameter to the function, most callers
should not care, if they don't really need to.

Renamed it to uart_memres_set_mmio_range().

This helper is meant for drivers that don't work w/ struct resource,
or explicitly set their own len.



Thanks for your review.
