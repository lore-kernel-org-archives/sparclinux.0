The manual seems to have changed in that regard.

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html
and earlier versions say:

"The aligned attribute can only increase the alignment; but you can
decrease it by specifying packed as well. See below."

but http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.5/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html
and later versions say:

"When used on a struct, or struct member, the aligned attribute can only
increase the alignment; in order to decrease it, the packed attribute
must be specified as well. When used as part of a typedef, the aligned
attribute can both increase and decrease alignment, and specifying the
packed attribute will generate a warning."

And seems to still be a bit confusing, as an attribute in a
variable declaration seems to count as typedef:

| struct foo {
|         void *bar;
| };
| 
| static struct foo a __attribute__((__aligned__(2)));
| static struct foo b;
| 
| struct foo2 {
|         void *bar;
| } __attribute__((__aligned__(2)));
| 
| static struct foo2 c __attribute__((__aligned__(2)));
| static struct foo2 d;
| 
| struct foo3 {
|         void *bar;
| } __attribute__((__aligned__(2))) __attribute__((__packed__));
| 
| static struct foo3 e;
| 
| int main() {
|         printf("a: %d, b: %d, c: %d, d: %d, e: %d\n",
|                 __alignof__(a), __alignof__(b),
|                 __alignof__(c), __alignof__(d),
|                 __alignof__(e)
|                 );
|         return 0;
| }

gives something like:
a: 2, b: 4, c: 2, d: 4, e: 2
or on sparc64:
a: 2, b: 8, c: 2, d: 8, e: 2

One fix might be to move the __attribute__ from include/trace/ftrace.h
(and from include/linux/syscalls.h) to include/linux/ftrace_event.h
and attach it to the struct there. This way it should only increase it.

Is that actually misaligned? Unless I still mix things up, that is in the
struct thus should be fine (i.e. the "d" case in my example above).
