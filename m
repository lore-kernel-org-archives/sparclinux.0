This flag is set even when /proc/self/mem is used. I've not looked deeply into
this flag but perhaps accessing your own memory this way can be considered
'remote' since you're not accessing it directly. On the other hand, perhaps this
is just mistaken in this case?

Thanks, I am more than happy to go as far down this rabbit hole as is helpful,
no imposition at all :)
