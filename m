I guess you are only talking about the changes to xen-pcifront.c?
Otherwise you are ignoring the dom0 case which is exposed to the real
set of PCI root complexes and anyway I'm not sure how "not needed for
Xen domU" translates into not required, since it is clearly required for
other systems.

Strictly speaking the Xen pciif protocol does support multiple buses,
it's just that the tools, and perhaps kernels, have not yet felt any
need to actually make use of that.

There doesn't seem to be any harm in updating pcifront to follow this
generic API change.
