meta-comment.  This new infrastructure doesn't seem to save any code
when you need to have a new "link table".  Yes, the macros seem a bit
nicer, but it feels like unneeded churn.  I haven't seen any patches in
this series that makes me go "oh yeah, now I see why he did this work,
it's so much simpler and easy to understand now!"

What am I missing?  What wonderful new things are going to happen, or
where is the code savings going to come from with this series to justify
all of the work to create and review this?

thanks,
