Sorry for the late reply.  I'll stay in this thead despite the
new version beeing posted to not lose the context.

The import bit is to have the 1:1 kmalloc/kfree pairing in slave_alloc
and slave_destroy to have consistant lifetime rules.  Using ->hostdata
is just ad tad cleaner ontop.   And given the number of targets an SPI
bus has, aswell as the number of luns seen on them the complexity
should not be a problem at all - if this was needed in a hotish path
in a fibrechannel drivers things would be different :)

SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY if you couldn't execute it due to a
lun/target-level resource shortage, or SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY
if it's a host-level or global resource shortage.  The
SCSI_MLQUEUE_EH_RETRY above was a typo no one notices and should
not be returned at all.

aic7xxx might not be the best driver to look at either :)  In practice
a softirq has short enough latency so this doesn't matter, but you
should probably benchmark it on your hardware.  53x700.c which is
the most modern scsi driver and is in about the same hardware class
as the esp gets away without using internal queues, but it also
has a nice internal buffer where commands can just be put into slots
for later execution.

Btw, using the block layer tcq code and the scsi wrappers for it
would be nice aswell.

As I said the value really doesn't matter.  We should probably get rid
of it and generate an uniqueue enough value in the midlayer instead to
keep the legacy API users happy.
