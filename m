I'm not sure where you're disagreeing with me. open of procfs symlinks
does not resolve the symlink and open the resulting pathname. They are
"magic symlinks" which are bound to the inode of the open file. I
don't see why this action, which is already special for magic
symlinks, can't check a flag on the magic symlink and possibly close
the corresponding file descriptor as part of its action.

In any case, whether/how fexecve works with interpreters is something
the kernel can change without breaking userspace expectations. My goal
is to avoid creating any new API/ABI requirement here.
