Right.

Right a PMD aligned valid PFN might not even exist. This proposed patch
which attempts to allocate memory chunk with required alignment will just
fail indicating that such a valid PFN does not exist and hence will skip
any relevant tests. At present this is done for PUD aligned allocation
failure but we can similarly skip PMD relevant tests as well if PMD
aligned memory chunk is not allocated.

Agreed. So do we have an agreement that it is better to use allocated
memory with required alignment for the tests than known-to-exist PFNs ?
