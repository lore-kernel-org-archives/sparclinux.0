Hello David!

Oh, no! Please don't thank me. That's as if my grandma would have thanked a=
fter I've eaten her tasty cake... :)
I thank you and Roland very much for the fast and professional help! You di=
d a very good job!
I still can't use OpenMPI over the ConnectX adapter (another error) but tha=
t's not for the SPARC list I think.

I think you've eliminated the BUG we talk about. :)
Again: I've applied the patch against 2.6.39.4 manually. I can't say if it =
also works with linux-3.1.1 because of OFED-1.5.4-rc4 .

Now if I run 'ibv_devinfo' I get no kernel BUG messages anymore and my=20
system doesn't hang if I use one of the ibv_*_pingpong utilities:
---
cluster1:~# ibv_rc_pingpong -n 1000000
=A0 local address:=A0 LID 0x0006, QPN 0x04004e, PSN 0x411c25, GID ::
=A0 remote address: LID 0x0003, QPN 0x0c004a, PSN 0xc6aa3d, GID ::

1000000 iters in 19.59 seconds =3D 19.59 usec/iter

cluster2:~# ibv_rc_pingpong -n 1000000 cluster1

1000000 iters in 19.60 seconds =3D 19.60 usec/iter

BTW: If you need someone in the future for testing a SPARC64 patch - just w=
rite me!

Regards and have a nice weekend,
Lukas
