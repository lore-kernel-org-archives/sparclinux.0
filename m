But I'm thinking that we need to move away from pcibios_add_bus() interface to do
something that should be generic. You don't need to be called for every bus when all
you want is just the root bus in order to add the MSI chip. Also, from looking at
the current patchset, a lot of architectures would set the MSI chip to a global
variable, which means you don't have an option to choose the MSI chip based on the
bus.

Breaking out the host bridge creation from root bus creation is not difficult, just not
agree upon. That would be the first step in making the generic host brige structure
useful for sharing, specially if used as a sort of "parent" structure that you can
wrap with your actual host bridge structure.

Not if you want to use the generic pci_scan_root_bus() function. One needs to copy the code
and add their own needed modifications. Which makes it hard to fix bugs and prevents code
reuse.
