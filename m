I inspected every arch and found there are almost no common stuff, and generic data struct should
be created in generic PCI code. Another, I don't like associate msi chip and every PCI device, further more,
almost all platforms except arm have only one MSI controller, and currently, PCI enumerating code doesn't need
to know the MSI chip details, like for legacy IRQ, PCI device doesn't need to know which IRQ controller they
should deliver IRQ to. I would think more about it, and hope other PCI guys can give some comments, especially from Bjorn.

Thanks!
