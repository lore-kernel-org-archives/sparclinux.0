Based on your memory layout, it would appear that end_pfn was not
initialised at startup. What is the full dmesg output when
CONFIG_MEMORY_INIT is set and mminit_loglevel=4? It'll tell me what
ranges of memory were actually initialised.

hmm, it still should be a MAX_ORDER boundary. HPAGE_SIZE defines
pageblock_order and it should be smaller than MAX_ORDER. Has this
changed?

Potentially, but unlikely. The number of areas that read a block of
pages are fairly small and relatively recent. move_freepages() is one
obviously and it had that BUG_ON() in place just in case this assumption
triggered. Conceivably, you might also be able to trigger badness with 
"cat /proc/pagetypeinfo".

The real badness happens when pages belonging to different zones or node are
considered to be buddies of each other and merged but that situation would
not have triggered on your machine at least.

!HOLES_IN_ZONE
	If any one PFN within a MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES is valid, then you
	can assume all PFNs in there are valid.

HOLES_IN_ZONE
	Due to memory holes or unaligned zones, all PFNs within a
	MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGE may not be valid.

What this affects in practice is what pfn_valid_within() does. If you are
walking all the PFNs within a MAX_ORDER block, you need to call pfn_valid()
once per MAX_ORDER and pfn_valid_within() for each PFN. When
!HOLES_IN_ZONE, this becomes a no-op.

Possibly not. If we ensure there is valid memmap for each PFN within a
MAX_ORDER block, then they would get marked reserved and never merged.
Other walkers should just ignore them in that case and you don't need
HOLES_IN_ZONE.

It'd be down to luck.

Nice maybe, but we'd take a hit on pfn_valid_within() which goes from
being compiled-away on architectures that don't need it to being
a read of a shared cacheline and a branch.
