OK, then I suggest moving it under CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE guards rather
than CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.

My understanding is that doing that in arch code is more appropriate
because it makes the generic code less complicated. But I do not have
any strong opinion on that. Looking at other ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTPLUG
and others suggests that we should be consistent with that.
