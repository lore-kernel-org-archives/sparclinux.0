Right, in my head I was thinking "must have been zeroed" which isn't
what it says. I'll switch to "zero".

I hadn't seen this patch before, and I have a few questions taking a
look at it:

 * An error code for a particular behaviour was changed (EFBIG ->
   E2BIG). Is this not a userspace breakage (I know Linus went ballistic
   about something similar a while ago[1]), or did I misunderstand what
   the issue was in [1]?
   * At the risk of bike-shedding -- of we are changing it, wouldn't
	 -EMSGSIZE be more appropriate? To be fair, picking errno values has
	 always been more of an art than a science, but to my ears "Argument
	 list too long" doesn't make too much sense in the context of
	 "returning" a struct back to userspace (and the cause of the error
	 is that the argument passed by user space *isn't big enough*). If
	 there was an E2SMALL that would also work. ;)

 * Do you want me to write a patch based on that, to switch it to
   copy_struct_to_user()?

 * That patch removes the "are there non-zero bytes in the tail that
   userspace won't know about" check (which I have included in mine). I
   understand that this caused issues specifically with sched_getattr(2)
   due to the default value not being zero -- how should we rectify that
   (given that we'd hopefully want to port everyone who uses that
   interface to copy_struct_{to,from}_user())?

 * Given that the [uk]attr->size construct is pretty important to the
   usability of the sched and perf interfaces, should we require (or
   encourage) it for all struct-extension syscall setups?

Good to know, though I'll rename it to avoid confusion.
