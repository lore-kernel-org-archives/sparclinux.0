So, on reflection, I think it's worth saying something about this, and 
I added the following text to the man page:

   NOTES
       When asked to execute a script file, the argv[0] that  is  passed
       to  the  script  interpreter is a string of the form /dev/fd/N or
       /dev/fd/N/P, where N is the number of the file descriptor  passed
       via  the  dirfd argument.  A string of the first form occurs when
       AT_EMPTY_PATH is employed.  A string of the  second  form  occurs
       when the script is specified via both dirfd and pathname; in this
       case, P is the value given in pathname.

Thanks,

Michael
