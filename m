That is mostly what I am doing here.  The original implementation was
mostly for performance.  I am trying to take the attribute that was
already in place for ARM and apply it to all the other architectures.
So what will be happening now is that we call the map function with
this attribute set and then use the sync functions to map it to the
device and then pull the mapping later.

The idea is that if Jesper does his page pool stuff it would be
calling the map/unmap functions and then the drivers would be doing
the sync_for_cpu/sync_for_device.  I want to make sure the map is
cheap and we will have to call sync_for_cpu from the drivers anyway
since there is no guarantee if we will have a new page or be reusing
an existing one.
