Hi James,

Thansk for the info. I will try some experiments and see if I can work 
out where the scsi commands/responses are getting lost.

I do not beleave the issue with the ESP is a hardware problem. The PROM 
and SunOS-4.1.1 have no problem finding/accessing the disk on the ESP and 
I did not observe any issues prior to testing Linux v2.6.22. The V1 ESP 
SCSI driver never failed to find the ESP disk (on kernels that got that 
far) but I have not done as much testing with the V2 ESP driver as memory 
problems post v2.6.21 needed to be fixed to get things up and running.

Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
