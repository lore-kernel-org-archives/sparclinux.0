In the long run, you are probably correct, and it would be simple enough 
to change this.  However, given the recent threads about the 
applicability of Relaxed Ordering and a couple of PCIe root complexes 
that have been found to have issues with Relaxed Ordering TLPs, I prefer 
to stay on the conservative side and set it up only for the platform I 
know.  As it stands, this patch won't change the currently working 
behavior on other platforms, but will help us out on the one we know can 
use the feature.
