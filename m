I do not insist but I would really _prefer_ if the bool zero argument
didn't proliferate all over the memblock API.

I do not think this is the right approach. Your measurements just show
that sparc could have a more optimized memset for small sizes. If you
keep the same memset only for the parallel initialization then you
just hide this fact. I wouldn't worry about other architectures. All
sane architectures should simply work reasonably well when touching a
single or only few cache lines at the same time. If some arches really
suffer from small memsets then the initialization should be driven by a
specific ARCH_WANT_LARGE_PAGEBLOCK_INIT rather than making this depend
on DEFERRED_INIT. Or if you are too worried then make it opt-in and make
it depend on ARCH_WANT_PER_PAGE_INIT and make it enabled for x86 and
sparc after memset optimization.
