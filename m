If that was the case, we would have never added it :-)

OK, we can remove it and I can see what breaks.

But aren't the __ex_table entries just two words? Which would align
nicely regardless.

The ftrace_event_call is a relatively large structure, as it may end on
a 4 byte alignement, the linker may start the next section with more
space to get it back to a 8 byte alignment. This is assuming that x86_64
packs the array in 4 bytes.

Hmm, perhaps changing the alignment in vmlinux.lds.h would fix that.

Anyway, I'll revert that commit and see if I can break it again. If so,
then I'll look for other solutions.

Thanks!
