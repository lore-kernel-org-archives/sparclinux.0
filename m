I've applied all 10 patches to my y2038 git branch [1], which is part
of linux-next,
to give it a little wider testing. If everything goes well, I'd send a
pull request to
Thomas next week so he can integrate it into tip from there, or (if he prefers)
send it directly to Linus in the merge window.

Thanks a lot for your persistence and your work on this!
