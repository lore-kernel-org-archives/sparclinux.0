A few things...

1. Does this need to be exposed to userland?
2. Can it end up in include/uapi/asm-generic/mman*.h ?
3. The definition of MAP_FIXED_SAFE should really have parens around it.

I'm surprised this doesn't warn - since this effectively expands to:

	flags & MAP_FIXED | MAP_KEEP_MAPPING

hence why MAP_FIXED_SAFE needs parens.
