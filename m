This makes the feature almost entire useless.

Non-hugepages must be in the initial implementation.

I strongly dislike this interface, and it makes the prtctl cases look
extremely ugly and hide to the casual reader what the code is actually
doing.

This is an mprotect() operation, so add a new flag bit and implement
this via mprotect please.

Then since you are guarenteed to have a consistent ADI setting for
every single VMA region, you never "lose" the ADI state when you swap
out.  It's implicit in the VMA itself, because you'll store in the VMA
that this is an ADI region.

I also want this enabled unconditionally, without any Kconfig knobs.

Thanks.
