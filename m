The ABI is very vague about it. The V9 ABI just displays that 6-word space 
in a figure bug doesn't say anything about it's usage. The V8 ABI just 
says that "the function may write incoming arguments there". If it may 
write anything other, it is unknown --- probably yes, but it is not said 
in the document.

The document nicely specifies who owns which registers, but doesn't say 
that about the stack space :-(
