The motivation was letting the code be tested on other architectures.

But once si_trapno falls inside the union instead of being present for
every signal reporting a fault it doesn't really matter.

I think it would be poor taste but harmless to use si_trapno, mostly
because defining a new entry in the union could be more specific and
well defined.
