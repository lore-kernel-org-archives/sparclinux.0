Sparc32 keeps having it's cBPF JIT after these changes.

Thanks to Daniel and Alexei for their invaluable feedback and review.

---

since v1:
 -- add tail call support
 -- fix MOD generation to not emit the same constant load several times
 -- flush icache over entire buffer properly
 -- do STACK_BIAS adjustment of FP once in prologue
 -- remove useless sanity checks
 -- generate patches with -M -C

since RFC:
 -- rework register allocation so that we don't have to emit move
    instructions to get the arguments into place for calls
 -- allow FP as source for 64-bit ALU move operations
 -- don't emit NOP instructions in prologue, instead do multiple
    passes so that all the branch offsets settle down
 -- remove unnecessary checks on imm64 loads that verifier does
 -- consistently use bpf2sparc[] instead of direct register references
