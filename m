git grep .text  doesn't work but that is typically expected...
git grep \.text doesn't work as expected

Ah finally:

git grep "\.text" seems to work. But WTF.

But:

git grep SECTION_TEXT works as expected immediately.

I guess its a matter of perspective.

Sure but if you're grepping asm, you very likely know what to look for.

True and as I confirmed below, on PowerPC this is certainly not true.

Where did I have that? If you refer to the above SECTION_TEXT documentation, it
refers to SECTION_TEXT being for code, but the goal was to highlight that
SECTION_TEXT is for execution, while SECTION_RODATA was for data. This
certainly can use some love though, thanks, will just drop the SECTION_RODATA
reference *or* properly explain the whole thing below.

Will fix to ensure this is understood in proper context.

Definitely -- the goal was to give us central place to document some of this
obscure dark magic only a few witches and warlocks tend to be aware of.

:) Yes indeed, the little crusade over the PowerPC linker script comments
on .text and ro data is an example of how easily things can be misleading.

Sure, but what I was trying to say above is I'd rather have the basic
layout of the documentation finalized before we start getting into very
specific detailed elaborate details on some of these things. For instance
we still haven't decided if we wanted SECTION_TEXT or just require everyone
to hard code in .text in every place a user wants to use .text sections.
I'd rather settle that before trying to document mark_readonly().

Which is why I was suggesting perhaps an alternative name.

Well consider the issues below for a second... and keep in mind with linker
tables we are about to open the prospect to add more things into the kernel's
sections more easily than before.

Actually, sorry, in this case SECTION_ALL() *was* intended for things that are
not linker tables or section ranges, instead this was for globs that want to
use the new section macro names, so we only use this for:
*(SECTION_ALL(SECTION_RODATA)) at this time.  It would seem we just did not
have .text.* and friends (other section names documented here). So this is
more of a reaction to provide a way to use a glob for section names if they
have a macro name.

The idea was to add helpers to do the globbing more easily.

The glob for sections now documented   is SECTION_ALL()
The glob that is range specific        is SECTION_RNG_ALL()
The glob that is linker table specific is SECTION_TBL_ALL()

The only one needing SECTION_ALL() it turns out was .rodata:

-               *(.rodata) *(.rodata.*)                                 \
+               *(SECTION_RODATA) *(SECTION_ALL(SECTION_RODATA))        \

Agreed... Actually while at it -- anyone happen to know why the two dot thing
started creeping up?

A concern here is more abuse over this if we now expose APIs to users to
more easily customize sections. So let's review what the chances are.

$ git grep DEFINE_SECTION_RANGE| egrep -v "tools|include|Document"
kernel/kprobes.c:DEFINE_SECTION_RANGE(kprobes, SECTION_TEXT);

These require the actual desired section specified. Do we want
to just hide that ? Or are we OK in assuming users willing to use
proper names here?

For linker tables we actually provide full helpers for each section
type. So we have:

$ git grep DEFINE_LINKTABLE| egrep -v "tools|include|Document"
drivers/base/firmware_class.c:DEFINE_LINKTABLE_RO(struct builtin_fw, builtin_fw);
kernel/jump_label.c:DEFINE_LINKTABLE(struct jump_entry, __jump_table);
kernel/kprobes.c:DEFINE_LINKTABLE_INIT_DATA(unsigned long, _kprobe_blacklist);
lib/dynamic_debug.c:DEFINE_LINKTABLE(struct _ddebug, __verbose);

So for linker tables we're safe from abuse as we provide all direct use
of the section up to the implementation behind the scenes.

If we're happy then with people using a proper section name for section
ranges then I think we can require the full section name being
spelled out.

I'd like address this in asm.h but I would hope we can do this as a secondary
step, given the length of this patch set already. Thoughts ?

You're right the above can use some love to help explain this better.

How about:

At the top just use "Linux sections helpers"

Then:

/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * We document below a dedicated set of helpers used in Linux to make sections
 * defined in the Linux linker script accessible in C code in a generic form and 
 * and provide certain attributes about them.
 */

> I just can't work out what exactly is a

> gives you.

Its a way to replace the:

extern char foo[], foo__end[];

So this provides a generalized form to use declarations used in C code to make
the linker script start and end symbols from esctions accessible in C code. Since
DEFINE_SECTION_RANGE() and DEFINE_LINKTABLE() macros use this, then the
DECLARE_LINUX_SECTION() is only needed if you need access to these symbols in C
code outside of the one that is defining and mainly in charge of managing the
section. We provide DECLARE_*() helpers for section ranges and linker tables
though so those can be used instead to help annotate the type of a custom
section they are.

So for instance, since the following tables are used in C code outside
of the code that implemented and manages them:

mcgrof@ergon ~/linux-next (git::20160822-linker-table-v5)$ git grep DECLARE_LINKTA| egrep -v "Documentation|tools|tables"
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/core.c:DECLARE_LINKTABLE_RO(struct builtin_fw, builtin_fw);
include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:DECLARE_LINKTABLE(struct _ddebug, __verbose);
include/linux/jump_label.h:DECLARE_LINKTABLE(struct jump_entry, __jump_table);
include/linux/kprobes.h:DECLARE_LINKTABLE(unsigned long, _kprobe_blacklist);

Note that the big trick here was to enable users to associate a new custom
section in C to a well defined already existing Linux section without modifying
the Linux linker script. Then, since as we observe and study uses of how Linux
sections are used, we've noticed a pattern -- most declarations of these sections
of really of two types, a section ranges or linker table. The patch set then
provides generic building blocks for these and ports a few existing custom Linux
sections to them as an example.
