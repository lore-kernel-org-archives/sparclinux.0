So on a 32bit system compat_sys_nanosleep() would be the legacy
sys_nanosleep() with the existing syscall number, but you don't want to
introduce a new sys_nanosleep64() for 32bit. That makes a lot of sense.

So back to your original question whether to use #if (MAGIC logic) or a
separate config symbol. Please use the latter, these magic logic constructs
are harder to read and prone to get wrong at some point. Having the
decision logic in one place is always the right thing to do.

Thanks,
