And I'm disagreeing with that statement which implies that it's something
that is an architecture wide property for any particular architecture.

Right now in mainline, if ARM has IOMMU support enabled, then SG_CHAIN
support will also be enabled.  I've a patch out of tree which I've been
using for years which enables SG_CHAIN for a particular SoC (Dove).
Otherwise, it doesn't have support for SG_CHAIN.

PARISC on the other hand (as you list) has no support to enable SG_CHAIN
under any circumstances.

Where we're disagreeing is whether this is something that is always-on or
always-off for any particular architecture.
