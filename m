Hi Yinghai, I knew code flow here would not cause problems, sorry the log
confused you, I will refresh it. But I think pci_scan_bus()/pci_scan_root_bus()
which could only be used during system boot up(before module_init) make
the pci scan logic obscure. Because most callers additionally call
pci_bus_size_bridges() and pci_bus_assign_resources() later,
so rip out pci_bus_add_devices() from pci_scan_bus()/pci_scan_root_bus()
make code have better readability.

Thanks!
Yijing.
