yes, that's what I suspected too. I suppose it is possible
from the compiler's point of view that something in between 
might change the result of in_softirq() so that we may be 
using an uninit variable in the second call.

anyway, the warning was annoying, and would only numb the
user into ignoring other real issues, so I figured I might
as well silence the warning.
