It is about write-combining from the CPU point of view. Right now there are
no devices with such advanced memory interface to do write combining on the
DMA side, but I believe that they might appear at some point in the future 
as well.

On ARM architecture it is already implemented this way and a bunch of drivers
use dma_mmap_coherent/dma_mmap_writecombine calls. We would like to standardize
these calls across all architectures.

That is just a starting point for the discussion. 

I thought about this API a bit and came to conclusion that there is no much
difference between a dma_alloc_coherent which creates a mapping in kernel
virtual space and the one that does not. It is just a hint from the driver
that it will not use that mapping at all. Of course this attribute makes sense
only together with adding a dma_mmap_attrs() call, because otherwise drivers
won't be able to get access to the buffer data.

On coherent architectures where dma_alloc_coherent is just a simple wrapper
around alloc_pages_exact() such attribute can be simply ignored without any
impact on the drivers (that's the main idea behind dma attributes!).
However such hint will help a lot on non-coherent architectures where 
additional work need to be done to provide a cohenent mapping in kernel 
address space. It also saves some precious kernel resources like vmalloc
address range.
