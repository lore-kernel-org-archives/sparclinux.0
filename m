I am still objecting to this fix.

gcc makes no provision for aligning an variable that has alignof() = 1

We had such issues in the past.

We need the proper annotation on ->val field itself, to get proper
alignment.

Then moving around the other field is a matter of avoiding a hole.

val should be an union, so that proper alignment is enforced by one
member.
