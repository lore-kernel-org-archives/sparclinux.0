Regardless, in all cases the semantics are absolutely clear; all
platforms *must* have a reliable way of obtaining the full path and
the path_component_name.  It it doesn't then it is fundamentally
broken.

Respin to fallback on WARN() and bail out.  I'd be okay with merging a
patch that does that.  Falling back to dp->name is absolutely incorrect.

I agree that API refinements can be deferred to 2.6.39.
