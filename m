Well, even when those allocation would fail the resulting behavior is
basically the same (modulo congestion_wait which imho doesn't make much
difference). So I would prefer not getting that way and simply stay with
the external loop vs. looping within the allocator.

Thanks

> GFP_NOFS|__GFP_NOFAIL is scary.

Yes it is but as I've learned nothing unusual in the fs land and the
situation should be improved a lot if we go reservation way suggested by
David. Then __GFP_NOFAIL would consume the pre-reserved memory rather
than trigger OOM killer.
