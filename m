Yes, we thought about that approach too. It would at least allow to
get all into stable, more or less nicely, as prerequisite for the s390
fix.

Two concerns kept us from going that way. For once, it might not be
the nicest way to get it all in stable, and we would not want to risk
further objections due to the imminent and rather scary data corruption
issue that we want to fix asap.

For the same reason, we thought that the generalization part might
need more time and agreement from various people, so that we could at
least get the first patch as short-term solution.

It seems now that the generalization is very well accepted so far,
apart from some apparent issues on arm. Also, merging 2 + 3 and
putting them first seems to be acceptable, so we could do that for
v3, if there are no objections.

Of course, we first need to address the few remaining issues for
arm(32?), which do look quite confusing to me so far. BTW, sorry for
the compile error with patch 3, I guess we did the cross-compile only
for 1 + 2 applied, to see the bloat-o-meter changes. But I guess
patch 3 already proved its usefulness by that :-)
