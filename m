That's truly strange.

For the qlogicpti.c driver case, try increasing
qpti->host_param.bus_reset_delay.

For the ESP failure as a module case, record and report the
time that passes around the msleep() calls.  If it's less
than it's trying to delay, that's the bug.

Your identify results are what I've seen when a device has recently
reset and is not fully ready yet, indicating that the post-reset delay
is not sufficient.

I'm %99 sure it's yet another sparc32 specific kernel bug of some sort
in both of these cases, especially since the qlogicpti.c driver hasn't
changed substantially in many many years.
