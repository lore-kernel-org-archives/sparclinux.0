Can you translate this for people who don't know all the SPARC acronyms?

x86 has an upcoming feature called protection keys.  A page of virtual
memory has a protection key, which is a number from 0 through 16.  The
master copy is in the PTE, i.e. page table entry, which is a
software-managed data structure in memory and is exactly the thing
that Linux calls "pte".  The processor can cache that value in the TLB
(translation lookaside buffer), which is a hardware cache that caches
PTEs.  On access to a page of virtual memory, the processor does a
certain calculation involving a new register called PKRU and the
protection key and may deny access.

Hopefully that description makes sense even to people completely
unfamiliar with x86.

Can you try something similar for SPARC?  So far I'm lost, because
you've said that the ADI tag is associated with a VA, but it has to
match for aliases, and you've mentioned a bunch of acronyms, and I
have no clue what's going on.
