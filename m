I see. Sorry for the noise then 8-) I've got a couple of scripts for testing
/proc and /sys and I just noticed that some of processes started by them
would run for a couple hours eating 100% CPU which doesn't happen on other
arch'es I have around - hence my report. Thanks for clarification.

That's true.

This patch certainly helps in my case. Tested here:

sparc64 # time cat /proc/1/pagemap > /dev/null
real    0m0.046s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.047s

Thanks,
