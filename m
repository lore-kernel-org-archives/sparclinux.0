introduced a potential NULL dereference to some drivers. In
particular, when the device is used as a console, incoming bytes can
kill the box. This is caused by removed checks for TTY against NULL.

It happened because it was unclear to me why the checks were there. I
assumed them superfluous because the interrupts were unbound or
otherwise stopped. But this is not the case for consoles for these
drivers, as was pointed out by David Miller.

Now, this patch re-introduces the checks (at this point we check
port->state, not the tty proper, as we do not care about tty pointers
anymore). For both of the drivers, we place the check below the
handling of break signal so that sysrq can actually work. (One needs
to issue a break and then sysrq key within the following 5 seconds.)

We do not change sc26xx, sunhv, and sunsu here because they behave the
same as before.  People having that hardware should fix the driver
eventually, however. They always could unconditionally dereference tty
in receive_chars, port->state in uart_handle_dcd_change, and
up->port.state->port.tty.

There is perhaps more to fix in all those drivers, but they are at
least in a state they were before.
