Commit 0cef77c7798a7 ("powerpc/64s/radix: flush remote CPUs out of
single-threaded mm_cpumask") added a mechanism to trim the mm_cpumask of
a process under certain conditions. One of the assumptions is that
mm_users would not be incremented via a reference outside the process
context with mmget_not_zero() then go on to kthread_use_mm() via that
reference.

That invariant was broken by io_uring code (see previous sparc64 fix),
but I'll point Fixes: to the original powerpc commit because we are
changing that assumption going forward, so this will make backports
match up.

Fix this by no longer relying on that assumption, but by having each CPU
check the mm is not being used, and clearing their own bit from the mask
if it's okay. This relies on commit 38cf307c1f20 ("mm: fix
kthread_use_mm() vs TLB invalidate") to disable irqs over the mm switch.

Fixes: 0cef77c7798a7 ("powerpc/64s/radix: flush remote CPUs out of single-threaded mm_cpumask")
