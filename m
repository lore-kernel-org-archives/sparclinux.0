Yeah, I was trying to squash any kind of recursion:

	lockdep -> other libs ->
		-> KCSAN
		-> print report
		-> dump stack, printk and friends
		-> lockdep -> other libs
			-> KCSAN ...

Some history:

* Initial patch to fix:
	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200115162512.70807-1-elver@google.com/

* KCSAN+lockdep+ftrace:
	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200214211035.209972-1-elver@google.com/

lockdep now has KCSAN_SANITIZE := n, but we still need to ensure that
there are no paths out of lockdep, or the IRQ flags tracing code, that
might lead through other libs, through KCSAN, libs used to generate a
report, and back to lockdep.

I never quite figured out the exact trace that led to corruption, but
avoiding any kind of potential for recursion was the only thing that
would avoid the check_flags() warnings.

Thanks,
