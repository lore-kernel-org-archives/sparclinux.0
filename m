I can help on the Git level: I can do tip:locking/rwsem tree with only these 
changes, with stable sha1's, on which the remaining work can be based. The
locking tree typically goes in early during the merge window, so there's no
real dependencies.

On the source code level this series is changing the existing locking code too,
it doesn't just add a new orthogonal method or so, so I'd really like to have
it in the locking tree.

Thanks,
