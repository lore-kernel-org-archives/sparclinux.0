I have only glanced through the code (there is a lot of the code to look
at here). And I do not like the code duplication and the way how you
make the hotplug special. There shouldn't be any real reason for that
IMHO (e.g. why do we init pfn-at-a-time in early init while we do
pageblock-at-a-time for hotplug). I might be wrong here and the code
reuse might be really hard to achieve though.

I am also not impressed by new iterators because this api is quite
complex already. But this is mostly a detail.

Thing I do not like is that you keep microptimizing PageReserved part
while there shouldn't be anything fundamental about it. We should just
remove it rather than make the code more complex. I fell more and more
guilty to add there actually.
