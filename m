Given the namei changes, I wanted to avoid stepping on Al's toes. Though
he did review the series a few versions ago, the discussion didn't focus
on the openat2(2) semantics (which have also changed since then). I'm
not sure whether to interpret the silence to mean he's satisfied with
things as they are, or if he hasn't had more time to look at the series.

As for which tree it should be routed to, I don't mind -- Christian is
the most straight-forward choice (but if Al wants to route it, that's
fine with me too).
