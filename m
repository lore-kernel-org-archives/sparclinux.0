Is there any reason you cannot do this from the userspace? Start by
mmap(PROT_NONE) and do mmap(MAP_FIXED|MAP_LOCKED|MAP_READ|other_flags_you_need)
from the SIGSEGV handler?
You can generate a lot of vmas that way but you can mitigate that to a
certain level by mapping larger than PAGE_SIZE chunks in the fault
handler. Would that work in your usecase?
