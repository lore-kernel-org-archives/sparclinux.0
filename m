It is still OK. About 9 threads per node.

That machine has 1T of memory, which means 8 nodes need to initialize 2G
of memory each. With 46G/s throughout it should take 0.043s Which is 10
times higher than what Daniel sees with 0.325s, so there is still room
to saturate the memory throughput.

Now, if the multi-threadding efficiency is good, it should take
1.261s / 9 threads =  0.14s

I am not arguing that your patches make sense, all I am saying that
ktasks improve time order of magnitude better on machines with large
amount of memory.
