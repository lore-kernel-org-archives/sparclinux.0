Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] sparc64: Add privileged ADI driver

ADI is a feature supported on SPARC M7 and newer processors to allow
hardware to catch rogue accesses to memory. ADI is supported for data
fetches only and not instruction fetches. An app can enable ADI on its
data pages, set version tags on them and use versioned addresses to
access the data pages. Upper bits of the address contain the version
tag. On M7 processors, upper four bits (bits 63-60) contain the version
tag. If a rogue app attempts to access ADI enabled data pages, its
access is blocked and processor generates an exception. Please see
Documentation/sparc/adi.txt for further details.

This patchset implements a char driver to read/write ADI versions from
privileged user space processes.  Intended consumers are makedumpfile
and crash.

v4:
  * Fixed messed up subject lines.
v3:
  * Really fixed the copyright headers to use SPDX GPL v2.  Really.
v2:
  * Simplified copyright headers
  * Completely reworked sparc64 selftests Makefiles.  Used the
    android selftests Makefiles as an example
  * Added run.sh and drivers_test.sh to the sparc64 selftest
    directory.  Used bpf/test_kmod.sh and the android selftests
    as examples
  * Minor cleanups in the selftest adi-test.c
  * Added calls to ksft_test_*() in the adi-test.c
