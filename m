From: "Luis R. Rodriguez" <mcgrof@kernel.org>

Linux provides a rich array of features, enabling each feature
however increases the size of the kernel and there are many
features which users often want disabled. The traditional
solution to this problem is for each feature to have its own
Kconfig symbol, followed by a series of #ifdef statements
in C code and header files, allowing the feature to be compiled
only when desirable. As the variability of Linux increases build
tests can and are often done with random kernel configurations,
allyesconfig, and allmodconfig to help find code issues. This
however doesn't catch all errors and as a consequence code that
is typically not enabled often can suffer from bit-rot over time.

An alternative approach for subsystems, which refer to as the 'build-all
link-selectively philosophy' is to keep the Kconfig symbols, replace
the #ifdef approach by having each feature implemented it its own C file,
and force compilation for all features to avoid the code bit-rot problem.
With this strategy only features that are enabled via Kconfig get
linked into the kernel, so the forced compilation has no size impact
on the kernel. The practice of having each feature implemented in its own
C file is already prevalent in many subsystems, however #ifdefs are still
typically required during feature initialization. For instance in:

  #ifdef CONFIG_FOO
  foo_init();
  #endif

We cannot remove the #ifdef and leave foo_init() as we'd either
need to always enable the feature or add a respective #ifdef in a
foo.h which makes foo_init() do nothing when CONFIG_FOO is disabled.

Linker tables enable lifting the requirement to use of #ifdefs during
initialization. With linker tables initialization sequences can instead
be aggregated into a custom ELF section at link time, during run time
the table can be iterated over and each init sequence enabled can be called.
A feature's init routine is only added to a table when its respective
Kconfig symbols has been enabled and therefore linked in. Linker tables
enable subsystems to completely do away with #ifdefs if one is comfortable
in accepting all subsystem's feature's structural size implications.

Subsystems which want to follow the 'build-all link-selectively
philosophy' still need a way to easily express and annotate that they
wish for all code to always be compiled to help avoid code bit rot,
as such two new targets force-obj-y and force-lib-y are provided to
help with this. Its not fair to require everyone to force compilation
of all features of a subsystem though, so as a compromise, the new
targets only force compilation when CONFIG_BUILD_AVOID_BITROT is
enabled.

Only built-in features are supported at the moment. Module support
is expected to be added after a generic solution to add linker
tables to modules more easily is developed.

v4: this patch was added to this series, it was split off from the
    linker tables addition due to the confusion over the code bit
    rot alternatives that are possible with linker tables.
