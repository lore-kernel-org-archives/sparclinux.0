My take out from discussion with you was that virtualization is probably
the only valid use-case.  So at David Miller's suggestion there's a
patch later in the series that adds virt_xxxx wrappers and these are
then used by virtio xen and later maybe others.

Right so the trick is checkpatch warns about use of
__smp_xxx and hopefully people are not crazy enough
to use virt_xxx variants for non-virtual drivers.
