Agreed. All good reasons to leave as is.

The only difference I see is an inversion of the test. Nesting order
is the same:

        int need_software_tstamp = sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMP);
        ...
        if (need_software_tstamp) {
                if (!sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
                } else {
                }
        }

vs

                if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMP)) {
                        if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
                        } else {
                        }
                }

I suggest just adding something like

        if (need_software_tstamp) {
+              if (sock_uses_new_tstamp(sk) {
+                   __sock_recv_timestamp_new(msg, sk,
ktime_to_timespec64(skb->tstamp));
+              } else if (!sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
-               if (!sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
                } else {
                }

and

                if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMP)) {
+                      if (sock_uses_new_tstamp(sk) {
+                           __sock_recv_timestamp_new(msg, sk, ts);
+                      else if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
-                       if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCVTSTAMPNS)) {
                        } else {
                        }

I think we can use the same helper for both the sock and tcp variant.
The only intended difference between the two functions, as described
in the tcp_recv_timestamp function comment, is the absence of an skb
in the tcp case. That is immaterial at this level.

Note also (2) tentative helper function sock_uses_new_tstamp(const
struct sock *sk) instead of testing sock_flag(sk, SOCK_TSTAMP_NEW)
directly. Since the .._NEW variants are equivalent to .._OLD on 64-bit,
I wonder if we can just compile out the branch. Something like

    static inline bool sock_uses_new_tstamp(const struct sock *sk) {
            return (sizeof(time_t) != sizeof(__kernel_long_t)) &&
                       sock_flag(sk, SOCK_TSTAMP_NEW);
    }

Yes, please avoid rearranging existing code as much as possible.

If there is any refactoring to be done, I think it would be to
deduplicate the shared logic between __sock_recv_timestamp and
tcp_recv_timestamp. I think the first can be rewritten to reuse the
second, if the only difference really is that the first takes an skb with
embedded timestamps, while the second directly takes a pointer to
struct scm_timestamping.

Either way, that's out of scope for this patchset.
