As I understand it, the requirement is because fast-gup walks without
the page table spinlock, or mmap_sem held so it must READ_ONCE the
*pXX.

It then checks that it is a valid page table pointer, then calls
pXX_offset().

The arch implementation of pXX_offset() derefs again the passed pXX
pointer. So it defeats the READ_ONCE and the 2nd load could observe
something that is no longer a page table pointer and crash.

Passing it the address of the stack value is a way to force
pXX_offset() to use the READ_ONCE result which has already been tested
to be a page table pointer.

Other page walking code that holds the mmap_sem tends to use
pmd_trans_unstable() which solves this problem by injecting a
barrier. The load hidden in pte_offset() after a pmd_trans_unstable()
can't be re-ordered and will only see a page table entry under the
mmap_sem.

However, I think that logic would have been much clearer following the
GUP model of READ_ONCE vs extra reads and a hidden barrier. At least
it took me a long time to work it out :(

I also think there are real bugs here where places are reading *pXX
multiple times without locking the page table. One was found recently
in the wild in the huge tlb code IIRC.

The mm/pagewalk.c has these missing READ_ONCE bugs too.

So.. To change away from the stack option I think we'd have to pass
the READ_ONCE value to pXX_offset() as an extra argument instead of it
derefing the pointer internally.
