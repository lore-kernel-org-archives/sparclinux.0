Your patch as sent would end up with:

ARM selects ARCH_HAS_SWIOTLB
SWIOTLB is defaulted to ARCH_HAS_SWIOTLB
SWIOTLB selects NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH

due to:

@@ -106,6 +106,7 @@ config ARM
        select REFCOUNT_FULL
        select RTC_LIB
        select SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION
+       select ARCH_HAS_SWIOTLB

and:

+config SWIOTLB
+       bool "SWIOTLB support"
+       default ARCH_HAS_SWIOTLB
+       select NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH

Therefore, the default state for SWIOTLB and hence NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH
becomes 'y' on ARM, and any defconfig file that does not mention SWIOTLB
explicitly ends up with both these enabled.

See above.

That would help to avoid any regressions along the lines I've spotted
by review.

It does look a bit weird though - patch 10 arranged stuff so that we
didn't end up with SWIOTLB always enabled, but this patch reintroduces
that with the allowance that the user can disable if so desired.
