A few sparc64 bug fixes and proper 64-bit rwsem support as you
suggested.

1) Fetching large device properties from openfirmware spams all
   over the kernel data section, based upon a report by Meelis
   Roos.  The fix is to just use the caller's buffers directly
   instead of this unnecessary 3k bounce buffer business.

2) The atomic64_t interface 'long' cases I missed.

3) Lock loop backoff didn't really NOP out correctly on UP.

4) Perf control register writes would write the register
   twice by mistake due to a missing delay slot nop.  Fix
   from Mikulas Patocka.

Please pull, thanks a lot!
