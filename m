Under ordinary circumstances, it should not sneak into the buddy allocator. If
it is not initialised, then the page zone and node linkages will also not
be setup and none of the flags, critically PageBuddy, will never get set
either so it cannot merge. Things like move_freepages(), lumpy reclaim
and /proc/pagetypinfo read them though which is bad.

==
If a PFN is not in early_node_map[] then the struct page for it is not
initialised. If there are holes within a MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES range of
pages, then PG_reserved will not be set. Code that walks PFNs within
MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES will then use uninitialised struct pages.

To avoid any problems, this patch initialises holes within a MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES
that valid memmap exists but is otherwise unused.
==

On a different note, deleting that BUG_ON would also have been safe in
this context as PageBuddy() would not have been set.

tmp is a horrible name and can be declared below

int actual_nid;

or something similar to indicate it is the NID as identified by
early_node_map[].

Ok, I think these changes are safe. I looked at the other callers of
early_pfn_in_nid() and to have any trouble, they would have to be
passing in PFNs that make no sense.

Because you check -1, I also see no way for memmap for nodes to be
accidentally initialised twice.

Other than the tmp thing which is pure cosmetic
