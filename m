We can, it was just a matter of deciding if we were OK with open coding the
section, copying over some defines, or sharing somehow (this was one way) the
header files.

Josh seems to prefer to open coding out the names on the tools we can certanly
do that here as well, I think his point that the names should/will likely
never change is sufficient motivation to avoid all this and prefer open coding
this.

Will do that in the next spin unless I hear otherwise.
