Is there a good an easy case to detect if a core has a cache?  Either
runtime or in Kconfig?

What about CF_PAGE_NOCACHE?  Reading arch/m68k/include/asm/mcf_pgtable.h
suggest this would cause an uncached mapping, in which case something
like this should work:

If we really just care about FEC we can just switch it do use
DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT and do explicit cache flushing.  But as far
as I can tell FEC only uses DMA coherent allocations for the TSO
headers anyway, is TSO even used on this SOC?
