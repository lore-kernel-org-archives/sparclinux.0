This set of patches update sparc64 so no deprecated genirq
features are used.

I did this mainly to understand the genirq stuff better.
Originally I looked into sparc64 code and was confused
because it used deprecated stuff. So the logical step
was to update sparc64 to avoid the deprecated stuff.
So I did so and the result follows.

This is an RFC because:
- This is not yet tested
- I expect a (trivial) conflict when we get Thomas'
  __DO_irq stuff merged
- I expect to get some feedback that needs to be addressed

I made one conceptual change.
irq_handler_data was previously assinged to irq_data.chip_data.
This is changed so it uses irq_data.handler_data

Looking into kernel/irq/* this looked OK.

I plan to do some testing within the next week.

I looked at integrating struct virt_irq_table[] as
chip_data in irq_data.
But the way the virt_irq_alloc() function is used did not
make this bovious how to do so. So I played safe and did
not try to do so.

Any comments aprreciated.
If there are more features from genirq we could use let me
know and I may look at it.
And if something just looks wrong please say so too.

	Sam
