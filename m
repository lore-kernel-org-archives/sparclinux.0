That was also the case for userpsace tools in scripts/ -- for instance
scripts/mod/modpost.c made an exception. What I've proposed here to
keep things simple was to ensure -UKERNEL is passed and then only
include files we know will work.

Refer to the patch "kprobes: port .kprobes.text to section range"
in this series for an extension of the scripts/mod/modpost.c kernel
headers use.

Its a fair strategy, however if upstream changes the order name we'd
have to hand code this as well, by using a macro we keep it all in one
place.

Indeed, which is why I was hoping to instead stick to a standard
sections set of header files that lets us get these in on place.
The only place I hand coded in this series was in the perl
file scripts/recordmcount.pl but I suppose if we wanted to get
creative we could even generate a header for it too.

If we want to avoid all this hacker include stuff another option
is to *generate* each respective sections.h for the kernel, and
also, one for tools, and one for perl. What do you think?
