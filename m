Nope, there is nothing connected to eth4. UP indicates that
I had issue `ip link set dev eth4 up`.

Nobody expects the... lack of a switch. And since there are
plenty of ports in the machine anyway, might as well use them as a
software switch as an intermediate solution.

eth0 through eth3 is a quad-port e1000e.
eth4 through eth7 is the quad-port niu.

The e1000e ports don't flake out at all, therefore I rate
the peer(s) being at fault with a very low probability.

The issue is not pressing, since it's just service processors
which are connected.
