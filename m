Hmm, wow OK, sorry, and I thought I was being too verbose...

OK so first, linker tables allow for the ability to help simplify initialization
sequences so that you no longer have to add the respective static inline in
header files to do nothing, instead you simply get your init routine for your
feature pegged into the linker table or not at link time. If enabling your
feature does not require structural changes, you could then safely enable
compiling this feature all the time, and only allow linking when the feature
was enabled. We don't have an easy way to express this in our build system,
the new targets added lets you accomplish this.

The ones listed below, table-obj-y and table-lib-y

It would be up to maintainers for each subsystem/feature to decide if they want
to use the new targets or not within their subsystem.

If you have CONFIG_BUILD_AVOID_BITROT enabled and some code using the special
targets do not get built it means the dependencies it has were not met.

It mean you can count on a bit more build test coverage by
CONFIG_BUILD_AVOID_BITROT users. Using table-obj-y is functionally
equivalent to doing:

extra-y += foo.o
obj-y += foo.o

The above new targets are just short hand annotations for the same.  We could
actually use another shorthand prefix other than table-, however linker tables
help making more of these type of targets possible. For instance, on initialiation
sequences you no longer have to add each line for each feature onto a set routine,
rather you just get the initialization routine linked in or not. This lets us avoid
cluttering C code and header code with #idefs, and as a side consequences also
allows more targets to be compiled without implicating functionality.

As a developer you should take care to to use table-obj-y, or table-lib-y only if
you are certain the target does not require structural changes.

It depends on their build system capability and their goals. If they wish
to be able to report build bugs and have a decent build system they can
enable this. Otherwise they should disable it.

By enabling this feature you compile kconfig symbols that typically are
disabled by most users and which have been identified by maintainers as
needing more build testing love. The extra kconfig symbols built are
only built if the dependencies for them are met.

Maintainers for subsystems would have to identify if they have key pieces of
software that typically get disabled, and that enabling them would not incur or
require structural changes, which can use more build test love.

By disabling this feature you only compile kconfig symbols you have
enabled for your kernel.

You would care if you aware of certain kconfig symbols that do not
get much build test love.

It enables maintainers to annotate through the build system certain
kconfig symbol which should be built if CONFIG_BUILD_AVOID_BITROT is
enabled and its symbol dependencies are met.
