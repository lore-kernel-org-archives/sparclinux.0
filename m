Because there can be issues in architecture-optimized algorithm
implementations that don't exist in the generic implementations.  That's
a very common class of issue that has repeated over time.

Huh?  We've been refactoring how the various crypto and CRC algorithms
are integrated, for all architectures.

So people outside the SPARC community, especially myself, been having to
spend quite a bit of time updating the SPARC code so that it can still
be used.

And this isn't new.  I've had to patch arch/sparc/crypto/ many times
over the years as things change in the crypto subsystem.  Many other
people, again outside the SPARC community, have as well.

The fact that you're denying that we've had to do this is really
frustrating.  There is a significant maintenance cost to keeping this
code working, which is being paid by people outside the SPARC community.

It seems best to at least focus that effort on modern algorithms like
AES and SHA-256, and not obsolete ones like MD5 and DES.  Note that
dropping those eliminates the need to add them to QEMU, as well.

I think that makes things easier for everyone.
