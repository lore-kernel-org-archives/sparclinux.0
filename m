Tried it with todays 2.6.39-rc7-00211-gc1d10d1. It was harder to 
reproduce this time, about 1 time out of 10.

In normal operation:

[   77.794877] found match; node=/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,hme@0,8c00000, driver=hme
[   77.872379] sunhme.c:v3.10 August 26, 2008 David S. Miller (davem@davemloft.net)
[   77.962865] eth0: HAPPY MEAL (SBUS) 10/100baseT Ethernet 08:00:20:88:6d:6a

In case of error (bpp show only as an example that some things work):

[   70.312166] found match; node=/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,bpp@e,c800000, driver=bpp
[   70.389649] parport0: sunbpp at 0x1ffec800000
[   70.477720] found match; node=/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,hme@0,8c00000, driver=hme
[   70.578023] found match; node=/sbus@1f,0/QLGC,isp@1,10000, driver=qpti
[   70.915544] hme: probe of f006be34 failed with error -22
[   70.978825] qpti: probe of f00798c4 failed with error -22
