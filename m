Just to clarify, the init.git was the repo of raw commits+series file
that was used for testing on linux next; now useless, except for showing
the last several weeks of history (hence the visual http link).  The
signed tag [separate repo] is the application of those commits against
the 3.14-rc1 tag, which was the end goal from the beginning.

Does history matter?  In the case of a cleanup like this, it does only
in the immediate context of this pull request; to help distinguish this
work from some short lived half baked idea that also had its testing
invalidated by arbitrarily rebasing onto the latest shiny tag.

I wouldn't have even mentioned the patch repo, except for the fact that
I know how Linus loves arbitrary rebases [and malformed pull requests]  :)

Thanks,
Paul.
