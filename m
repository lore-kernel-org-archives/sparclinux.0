Thanks!

I'm currently investigating using -finstrument-functions instead of -pg,
but if the overhead is too much, I may try to incorporate both.

Please note that this tracer is more of a "simple example". There's lots
of improvements that can be made. It was meant more of to show what mcount
can bring than to push the tracer itself.

I want to stress that the tracer in this patch set is a *much* simplified
version of the latency_tracer in the RT patch. I want to start out simple,
complexity can come later ;-)

This sounds great. My hope is that we can get the mcount (or cyg_profile)
functionality in the kernel that many different users can deploy.
