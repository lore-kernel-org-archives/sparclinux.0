Hello,

(could someone with a SJA1000 on SPARC perform a functional test
to see if interrupts are working? it would be great :-)

Changes since v2:
- Dropped patch 1 "can: sja1000: remove unused defines"
- Addressed Marc's comments on patch 4 and 6 (now 3 and 5)

Changes since v1:
- Merge sja1000_of_platform.c into sja1000_platform.c (patch 4)

The first part of this series performs serveral small cleanups
(patches 1 and 2).

Patch 3 merges sja1000_of_platform.c into sja1000_platform.c.
Changes are pretty conservatives (mostly copy/paste/move). IRQ
is treated differently in the OF and non-OF versions, thus this
is where the fused version differs the most.

The final part introduces the 'reg-io-width' binding (already used
by some other drivers) to perform a similar job as what was done
with IORESOURCE_MEM_XXBIT. This is needed on my system to correctly
take into account the aliasing of the address bus.

All patches were tested using OF boot on my OMAP3 system with a
memory-mapped SJA1000. Thus, the non-OF path is not tested, as
I do not have a platform data at hand.

Regards,
Florian
