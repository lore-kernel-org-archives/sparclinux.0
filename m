OK, so why cannot we make zero_struct_page 8x 8B stores, other arches
would do memset. You said it would be slower but would that be
measurable? I am sorry to be so persistent here but I would be really
happier if this didn't depend on the deferred initialization. If this is
absolutely a no-go then I can live with that of course.
