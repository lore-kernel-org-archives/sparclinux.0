No idea. I have just offered a way to do that. I do not think it is
anyhow useful but who knows... I do agree that the mlock should be used
for the full mlock semantic.

VM_FAULTPOPULATE would have to be sticky to prevent from other
speculative poppulation of the mapping. I mean, is it OK to have a new
mlock semantic (on fault) which might still populate&lock memory which
hasn't been faulted directly? Who knows what kind of speculative things
we will do in the future and then find out that the semantic of
lock-on-fault is not usable anymore.
