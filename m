Right. So now where we go from here ! We will need help from platform folks to
fix this unless its trivial. I did propose this on last thread (v2), wondering if
it will be a better idea to restrict DEBUG_ARCH_PGTABLE_TEST among architectures
which have fixed all pending issues whether build or run time. Though enabling all
platforms where the test builds at the least might make more sense, we might have
to just exclude arm32 and ia64 for now. Then run time problems can be fixed later
platform by platform. Any thoughts ?

BTW the test is known to run successfully on arm64, x86, ppc32 platforms. Gerald
has been trying to get it working on s390. in the meantime., if there are other
volunteers to test this on ppc64, sparc, riscv, mips, m68k etc platforms, it will
be really helpful.
