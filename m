Thanks, it was a great help as it uncovered a few issues in fringe arch
that I didn't have toolchains for, and I've fixed all of those up.

I've noticed that powerpc has been un-buildable for a while now; I have
used this hack patch locally so I could run the ppc defconfigs to check
that I didn't break anything.  Maybe useful for linux-next in the
interim?  It is a hack patch -- Not-Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker.  :)

Paul.
