I think it is used to assert that the select family of system calls
writes to the 1024 bits for each of the passed pointers.  Which is not
actually true=E2=80=94the write size is controlled by the file descriptor
count argument.

The footnote is missing.

Please use something that is more obviously Linux-specific.
