Headers should be self-contained, so that would be the best fix in my
opinion.

This being said, as cacheflush.h isn't needed in isp.c, I think we
should also drop it. It seems to have been included there since the
first driver version, and was likely a left-over from the out-of-tree
development. Manual cache handling was part of
drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/ispqueue.c and has been removed in
commit fbac1400bd1a ("[media] omap3isp: Move to videobuf2").

cacheflush.h can also be dropped from ispvideo.c which suffers from the
same issue.
