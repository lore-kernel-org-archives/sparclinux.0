The alternative solution would be to replace initrd_start/initrd_end
with physical address versions of these everywhere - that's what
we're passed from DT, it's what 32-bit ARM would prefer, and seemingly
what 64-bit ARM would also like as well.

Grepping for initrd_start in arch/*/mm shows that there's lots of
architectures that have virtual/physical conversions on these, and
a number that have obviously been derived from 32-bit ARM's approach
(with maintaining a phys_initrd_start variable to simplify things).
