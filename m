Hello everyone,

I think sparc32 problem is pmd is an array. So now I built a sparc64
compiler and built with ARCH=sparc32.

$ file vmlinux
vmlinux: ELF 32-bit MSB relocatable, SPARC, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped

I got it to build (the zImage won't build on my environment for some
assembly issue in arch/sparc/boot/btfix.S but that shall not be
related to this, all it matters is the final linking of vmlinux is
successful).

So to fix this once and for all, please apply this below patch. If
this works no change to any arch is required (ia64 could also revert
the __pmd definition if they prefer, not that it makes any relevant
difference for ia64 other than being more consistent with most other
archs).

Only the arm build fix from James most certainly is still needed in
addition to this.

Sorry again for this build issue.
Andrea

Subject: remove pmdp_get_and_clear/pmdp_clear_flush/pmdp_splitting_flush methods when THP=n

From: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>

pmdp_get_and_clear/pmdp_clear_flush/pmdp_splitting_flush were trapped
as BUG() and they were defined only to diminish the risk of build
issues on not-x86 archs and to be consistent with the generic pte
methods previously defined in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h.

But they are causing more trouble than they were supposed to solve, so
it's simpler not to define them when THP is off.

This is also correcting the export of pmdp_splitting_flush which is
currently unused (x86 isn't using the generic implementation in
mm/pgtable-generic.c and no other arch needs that [yet]).
