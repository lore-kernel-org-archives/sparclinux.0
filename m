Devices return CHECK_CONDITION and give SENSE (usually a
UNIT_ATTENTION) when they are given an INQUIRY command too soon after
a scsi bus reset, I saw it all the time when bringing up the new ESP
driver.

There is even special case code in the SCSI bus scan that accepts
certain special cases of UNIT_ATTENTION check conditions as valid:

		if (result) {
			/*
			 * not-ready to ready transition [asc/ascq=0x28/0x0]
			 * or power-on, reset [asc/ascq=0x29/0x0], continue.
			 * INQUIRY should not yield UNIT_ATTENTION
			 * but many buggy devices do so anyway. 
			 */
			if ((driver_byte(result) & DRIVER_SENSE) &&
			    scsi_sense_valid(&sshdr)) {
				if ((sshdr.sense_key = UNIT_ATTENTION) &&
				    ((sshdr.asc = 0x28) ||
				     (sshdr.asc = 0x29)) &&
				    (sshdr.ascq = 0))
					continue;
			}
		}

asc/ascq values that do not pass this test are what Mark is seeing.

And again this is almost always because the device is being sent
the INQUIRY too soon after a scsi bus reset.
