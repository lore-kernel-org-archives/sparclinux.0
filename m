I should probably mention that the same message actually did appear some
time later, but it seemed inconsequential because there was no /dev/sda to
boot from, and the machine eventually fell through to busybox shell where
it sat useless.

FWIW here's the remainder of the output:

qla2xxx 0001:00:04.0: QLogic Fibre Channel HBA Driver: 8.02.01-k4
  QLogic QLA22xx - 
  ISP2200: PCI (66 MHz) @ 0001:00:04.0 hdma-, host#=1, fw=2.02.08 TP
ohci_hcd 0000:00:05.3: OHCI Host Controller
ohci_hcd 0000:00:05.3: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
ohci_hcd 0000:00:05.3: irq 13, io mem 0x7fe01000000
usb usb1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found
hub 1-0:1.0: 4 ports detected

Then the initrd tries to mount sda1 and fails. Again, apologies if I screwed
something up while cleaning up the endless escape sequences.
