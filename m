I think this is wrong. argv[0] is an arbitrary string provided by the
caller and would never be derived from the fd passed. It's AT_EXECFN,
/proc/self/exe, and filenames shown elsewhere in /proc that may be
derived in odd ways.

I would also move the text about O_CLOEXEC to a BUGS or NOTES section
rather than the main description. The long-term intent should be that
script execution this way should work. IIRC this was discussed earlier
in the thread.
