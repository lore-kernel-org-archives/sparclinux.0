Hi Alex,

Please try to run your persistent memory init experiment with Daniel's
patches:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181105165558.11698-1-daniel.m.jordan@oracle.com/

The performance should improve by much more than 26%.

Overall, your works looks good, but it needs to be considered how easy it will be
to merge with ktask. I will try to complete the review today.

Thank you,
Pasha
