Very nice. I think it would be good to get this into linux-next soon so we
can build on top of this. I have submitted most other y2038 patches today
that don't depend on either this or one of my other patches.

There is one patch that I want to do but haven't imlpemented yet, to merge
get_timespec64() and compat_get_timespec() into one function that
take a bunch of flags (check nanosecond, nano/microsecond,
zero upper half of nanoseconds, 32-bit or 64-bit wide), since I found
a few functions that need more than one of these, and they don't
all need the same combinations. My patch will certainly conflict
with yours, as your touch the same functions, but that's fine.

If you end up doing another version of the series though, it might
be better to move the compat accessors into kernel/time/time.c
along with the native functions, that should make it easier to
consolidate them later.

Do you mean we would need to do this separately for native and compat
syscalls, and have yet another option, like LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS
and LEGACY_TIME_COMPAT_SYSCALLS, to cover all cases? I would
think that CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME handles all the compat versions,
while CONFIG_LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS handles all the native ones.
