Shouldn't the user be able to do this?

mlockall(MCL_CURRENT)
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE | MCL_ONFAULT);

Note that the second call shouldn't change (i.e. munlock) existing vma's 
just because MCL_CURRENT is not present. The current implementation 
doesn't do that thanks to the following in do_mlockall():

         if (flags = MCL_FUTURE)
                 goto out;

before current vma's are processed and MCL_CURRENT is checked. This is 
probably so that do_mlockall() can also handle the munlockall() syscall.
So we should be careful not to break this, but otherwise there are no 
limitations by not having two MCL_ONFAULT flags. Having to do invoke 
syscalls instead of one is not an issue as this shouldn't be frequent 
syscall.

Good point.

So again this should work:

mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_ONFAULT)
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE);

But the order matters here, as current implementation of do_mlockall() 
will clear VM_LOCKED from def_flags if MCL_FUTURE is not passed. So 
*it's different* from how it handles MCL_CURRENT (as explained above). 
And not documented in manpage. Oh crap, this API is a closet full of 
skeletons. Maybe it was an unnoticed regression and we can restore some 
sanity?
