Unnecessarily.  OLPC will still boot if the DT creation fails.  Even if
things are broken, it'll at least allow someone to report some errors
on the screen.  On the other hand, BUGing this early in boot means that
all a user will see is a black screen (or the OFW "loading kernel"
message). The framebuffer won't have been initialized, so.. yeah.

If it's a programmer who's hacking on this stuff, that's just
annoying.  If it's a user who has just upgraded their firmware and hit
a firmware bug in the field, that's much worse; it's
pretty much impossible to debug.

Ah, nice catch, thanks.

I'm fine with that, I just don't want to see BUG() happening that
early.  I think a workaround should be handled in common code.  I agree
that heroic workarounds for firmware bugs should be handled in
arch-specific pkg2path hooks, but a simple workaround in common code
is better than just crashing early in boot (imo).
