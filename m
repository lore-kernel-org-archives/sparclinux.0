Ah, okay, so the @limit which is in physical address can be over 4GB
even for lowmem mappings and alloc_bootmem takes them in ulongs,
urghhh....

Given that still about half of the archs aren't using memblock yet, I
think there are three options.

1. Converting all bootmem interface to use physaddr_t.  But that's
   what memblock is.

2. Introducing new interface.  Easier right now but the danger there
   is that it might end up duplicating most of alloc_bootmem()
   interface anyway and we'll have yet another variant of early mem
   allocator to enjoy.

3. Make all generic code use memblock interface instead of bootmem and
   implement memblock wrapper on archs which don't use memblock yet.
   We'll probably need to sort out different combinations of
   HAVE_MEMBLOCK and NO_BOOTMEM.  If this is doable, it probably is
   the most future proof way.  While it adds new memblock interface
   built on top of bootmem, it would also allow removing the bootmem
   interface built on top of memblock - ie. nobootmem.c, which
   probably is what we should have done from the beginning.

What do you guys think?

Thanks.
