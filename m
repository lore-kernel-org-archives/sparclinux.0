How do we guess the device's location when ACPI/BIOS does not set it?

It seems dev_to_node() does not do anything about that and leave the
job to the caller or whatever function that get called with its return
value, such as cpumask_of_node().

I missed the magic of the "unsigned" in your previous reply.

what do you mean by error? What I can think is three type of errors:
1) return NULL, this way it seems cpumask_of_node() also leave the
   job to the function that calls it.
2) cpu_none_mask, I am not sure what this means, maybe it means there
   is no cpu on the same node with the device?
3) give a warning, stack dump, or even a BUG_ON?

I would prefer the second one, and implement the third one when the
CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS is selected.

Any suggestion?

Thanks for the note and example.
