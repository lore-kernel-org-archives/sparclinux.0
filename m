And this is a followup to the prior patch; an optimization based
upon what we're doing with pkg2path stuff.

The sparc folks don't use pkg2path, so this shouldn't affect them at
all.

Cc'ing Mitch as well, in case there's some reason why I should be
wary of doing this.  :)




From: Andres Salomon <dilinger@queued.net>

The of_pdt_try_pkg2path() function currently allocates memory for
and fetches the full path name from OFW (of the form '/foo/bar/baz@0').
It then returns only the name ('baz@0)', and the caller re-constructs
the full name (for dp->full_name) based upon dp->parent->full_name and
what was returned by of_pdt_try_pkg2path().  Oh, and it allocates more
memory for it.

OLPC is the only architecture which fills in the pkg2path hook, so
this shouldn't affect any other users (ie, sparc).  Since in practice
(dp->parent->full_name + '/' + strrchr(pkg2path, '/')) and the result
from pkg2path end up being exactly the same, just short circuit the rest
of the of_pdt_build_full_name logic and set dp->full_name to the result
of pkg2path.  This means we don't have to parse it nor allocate more
memory for it.

This saves time, code, and memory.
