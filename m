Thanks for the explanation, much appreciated. I will drop the old->...
copying hunk.

Sorry, I meant to drop the copy-from-old logic -- not set it to zero
explicitly in set_nameidata().

Yup, I'll work up a version that does the consolidation you mentioned
in your other mail.

I have some self-tests of a symlink-to-a-magic-link in the last patch of
the series. Did you mean something even more chained like a symlink to a
/proc/self/fd/$n of an O_NOFOLLOW|O_PATH of a symlink?
