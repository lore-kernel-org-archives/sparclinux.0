Hey, this is an unfair characterization: lwn.net operates an early
access subscription model, so you can't read the above for 14 days
after publication without paying for an lwn.net subscription, but by
the time these patches are upstream there will be no paywall because it
will expire on 24 January and that URL will then be readable by all. 
That makes LWN.net a nice, reliable resource for us while still
supporting some business model to keep it going.
