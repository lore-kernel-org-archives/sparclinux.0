Applied to pci/resource for v4.14, thanks!

There's room for future improvement, e.g., using per-host callbacks,
etc., but I think this is a clear improvement as-is.

There's some folklore about the evils of weak symbols, but I don't
know the details.  It would be useful to have them codified somewhere
in Documentation/ or near the __weak definition.
