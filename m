I think the correct use for iterators would be:

	if (cpumask_first(mymask) >= nr_cpu_ids)

... since nr_cpu_ids is guaranteed to be <= nr_cpumask_bits.  And nr_cpumask_bits
is not really meant to be used anywhere except in the bit operations supporting
the cpumask_* operators.

I think that's broken anyways... ;-)

The change from NR_CPUS to nr_cpu_ids is ok, but it should also be changed from:

	(x = NR_CPUS)
to:
	(x <= nr_cpu_ids)

The problem often arises where an array is allocated that will use the
cpu as an index into the array.  They can be changed eventually to use a
percpu pointer, but in the interim keeping nr_cpu_ids intact maintains
compatibility without allocating unused memory.

I'll run the test again but most likely the result will be an extra 1Mb of
unused memory instead. ;-)  One other note, that test compile used the default
config [and NR_CPUS8] which turns off a lot of functions.  A typical distro
config will have many more options turned on.

And the beauty of using a separate flag to enable variable length cpumasks,
is there may be cases where an arch or specific system config wants a multiple
word cpumask on the stack for performance reasons (like cache or node locality,
avoidance of the kmalloc's, etc.)

We could change all refs from nr_cpu_ids to max_possible_cpu but wouldn't
we still be leaving a window open where it could be incorrectly used?
So far all the cpumask conversions allow for "mixed-use" cpumask (i.e.,
cpumask_t and struct cpumask *) by maintaining backwards compatility,
until everything is eventually sorted out.  Keeping nr_cpu_ids representing
the same value maintains this "compatibility bridge".

The most correct way would be to use the (not yet implemented) zero
based PERCPU allocator.  Slightly less efficient would be to allocate
node local memory for each struct, in a loop using a per cpu pointer
and "for_each_possible_cpu()".

But as I've said, it's not critical to the new functionality...

Thanks!
