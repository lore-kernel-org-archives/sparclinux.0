Correct.

No, the timer interrupts are controlled differently, as the IRQ source
lives inside of the CPU rather in some external entity.

I need to fix that by invoking tick_ops->disable_irq() here.  I'll take
care of this.

And IPI handler runs in HW irq context, therefore such an IPI-creates-an-IPI
should not be allowed, at least not directly.

Actually the restriction seems to be that an IPI cannot be sent when
"irqs_disabled()", hmmm...

This case is interesting, and I'm no sure what happens here.

Exactly.
