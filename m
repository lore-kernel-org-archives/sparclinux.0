Hi Luis,

The linker stuff in the kernel definitely needs someone to take care
of it, so it's good to see some effort to clean up and generalize some
of it.

Not all your patches seem to depend on each other, so it might be good
to push some of the cleanups through first. And some of these core
patches could go in bit by bit if necessary.

On this specific patch: while the as and ld sections syntax and
semantics are pretty ugly and esoteric, I question how much of this is
actually an improvement. Some of it seems to just be wrapping one name
with another, or hiding some behaviour in a maybe not intuitive way.

These, for example. The exact name of the section is important in linker
scripts and asm, so I can't see the benefit of hiding it. I could be
missing the bigger picture.

I can't see how these comments are right. .rodata doesn't seem like it
should be combined with .text, and is not currently on powerpc. I think
it's for data, not code.

This is another example. We know what .text.* does in the linker scripts
-- it's self documenting. But SECTION_ALL(.text)? I'm not sure that's an
improvement. Actually I saw it in the linker script changes and had to
come find the definition because I was a bit mislead:

SECTION_ALL(.text)

Initially I would expect this to be

.text*

Not

.text.*

The latter does not grab the .text section!

This does not seem like it belongs here. The name is fairly ugly too.
I guess something might be needed like this when dealing with generic
as directives common to all architectures, though. I would say
include/asm-generic/asm.h should be a better place.

I'm still not quite sure what a Linux de-facto/standard/common section is
after this. Are they output sections?

I think it would be reasonable to drop the LINUX_ prefix and references to
Linux.

Thanks,
Nick
