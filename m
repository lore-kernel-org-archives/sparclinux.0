These four need compat system call wrappers, unfortunately... (well,
actually only shmget and shmdt require them, but let's add them for
all four). See arch/s390/kernel/compat_wrapper.c

I'm afraid this compat special handling will be even more annoying in
the future, since s390 will be the only architecture which requires
this special handling.

_Maybe_ it would make sense to automatically generate a weak compat
system call wrapper for s390 with the SYSCALL_DEFINE macros, but that
probably won't work in all cases.
