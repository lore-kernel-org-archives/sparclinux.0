Yeah, IOMMUs can't guarantee that. The majority of architectures set
BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY to 0 so they don't hit this, I think.

I think that the block layer can handle this properly via
q->max_segment_size. We have the same value at two different
places. Yeah, it's not good...


BTW, inia100_template sets sg_tablesize to SG_ALL. If the controller
has at most 32 SG entries per request, we need to fix that.
