I would be interested in seeing those provided on Alpha.  There are
a handful of projects choosing to sidestep glibc for these syscalls
and they break on Alpha.  Such projects are never keen to include
special assembler code (because the extant syscalls on Alpha are not
C ABI compliant) to support a legacy arch.
