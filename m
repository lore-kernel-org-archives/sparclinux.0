Thanks, using non-raw now makes sense.

Right, I think we just have to tolerate the potential risk of deadlock
until there is a way to make all the code that prints in print_report()
scheduler-safe (that includes stack_trace_print()).

Based on your suggested change to core.c, how about the below patch?
Anything we've missed? If you think it's reasonable, please carry it
with the IRQ state tracking changes.

As far as I can tell there are no more warnings together with the other
patch you sent to add '& LOCKDEP_RECURSION_MASK'.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] kcsan: Make KCSAN compatible with new IRQ state tracking

The new IRQ state tracking code does not honor lockdep_off(), and as
such we should again permit tracing by using non-raw functions in
core.c. Update the lockdep_off() comment in report.c, to reflect the
fact there is still a potential risk of deadlock due to using printk()
from scheduler code.
