I've dropped the "[RFC] y2038: itimer: use ktime_t internally" patch
for the moment,
and added two other patches from other series:

y2038: remove CONFIG_64BIT_TIME
y2038: socket: use __kernel_old_timespec instead of timespec

Tentatively pushed out the patches with the Acks I have received so
far to my y2038 branch on git.kernel.org so it gets included in linux-next.

If I hear no complaints, I'll send a pull request for the merge window,
along with the compat-ioctl series I have already queued up in the same
branch.
