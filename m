"new" in the sense of "2 years old"?

Because the firmware needs to be programmed with the bus address.  It's
not unique in this; the Emulex lpfc driver should also be using this
function.

Er, pcmcia was already using it:

./drivers/pcmcia/i82092.c:      pcibios_resource_to_bus(sock_info->dev,
&region, mem->res);
./drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c:
pcibios_resource_to_bus(socket->dev, &region, mem->res);
./drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c:
pcibios_resource_to_bus(socket->dev, &region, &dev->resource[0]);

I suppose you don't test pci-pcmcia adapters very often on sparc64.

Is there a problem with adding the symbol export?  I noticed that v850
also doesn't export that symbol.
