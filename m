Daniel posted a separate patch showing his code, would you mind
commenting on that?  I noticed he didn't cc you though, here's the
patch:

This affects sparc as well; it changes behavior back for dp->name to
what it used to be.  dp->full_name behavior is still the same for sparc.

I'll combine patches and resend, thanks.
