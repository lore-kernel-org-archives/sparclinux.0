Makes sense but..

There is a small challenge with this. Modifying individual bits on a given
page table entry from generic code like this test case is bit tricky. That
is because there are not enough helpers to create entries with an absolute
value. This would have been easier if all the platforms provided functions
like __pxx() which is not the case now. Otherwise something like this should
have worked.


pud_t pud = READ_ONCE(*pudp);
pud = __pud(pud_val(pud) | RANDOM_VALUE (keeping lower 12 bits 0))
WRITE_ONCE(*pudp, pud);

But __pud() will fail to build in many platforms.

The other alternative will be to make sure memset() happens on all other
bits except the lower 12 bits which will depend on endianness. If s390
has a fixed endianness, we can still use either of them which will hold
good for others as well.

memset(pudp, RANDOM_NZVALUE, sizeof(pud_t) - 3);

OR

memset(pudp + 3, RANDOM_NZVALUE, sizeof(pud_t) - 3);

Got it.

Sure, got it. Though I plan to do add some arch specific tests or init sequence
like the above later on but for now the idea is to get the smallest possible set
of test cases which builds and runs on all platforms without requiring any arch
specific hooks or special casing (#ifdef) to be agreed upon broadly and accepted.

Do you think this is absolutely necessary on s390 for the very first set of test
cases or we can add this later on as an improvement ?

Right.
