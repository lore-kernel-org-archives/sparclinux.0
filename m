The existing code does this as well - if it first finds a RESET, it 
handles it then hits the return 0.  Next if it finds the UP, it does the 
goto back to the ldc_ctrl: to process, and hits the same return 0.  Only 
if neither of these bits have been seen does the code move on to process 
the DATA_READY event.

If we're seeing cases of both UP and DATA_READY, then yes we'll wnat to 
look at changing this logic.  I think that should be a separate patch.
