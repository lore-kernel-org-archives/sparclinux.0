Nope. In fact, it actually caused the kernel to die before I could get
it to mount the NFS root:

http://auroralinux.org/people/spot/e10k-dmesg-smp-promconsole.txt

Only changes were to disable netconsole and enable PROM_CONSOLE. Kernel
config is attached.

Well, I've got unlimited access to my very own fully populated e10k, but
no experience writing console drivers. :/

Unfortunately, the subset of people to whom I can give access to are
limited to those @redhat.com, due to the machine's location.
