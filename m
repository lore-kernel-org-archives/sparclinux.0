Doing complex allocations with the mm locked looks fragile no matter what: we 
should add debugging code that warns if allocations are done with a remote mm 
locked. (it should be trivial)

In fact people were thining about turning the mm semaphore into a rwlock - with 
that no blocking call should be possible with the lock held.

So I maintain:

If they don't expect EINTR then they sure don't expect SIGKILL either!

There's a (very) low number of system calls that are not interruptible, but the 
vast majority is.
