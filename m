Yes. I already know it and other trials for that a few years ago[1].
A few years ago, I investigated the benefit between power consumption
benefit during suspend VS start-up latency of resume and
power consumption cost of migration(page migration and IO write for
migration) and concluded normally the gain is not big. :)
The situation could be changed these days as workload are changing
but I'm skeptical about that approach, still.

Anyway, it's my private thought so you don't need to care about that.
If you are ready to submit the patchset, please send out.
