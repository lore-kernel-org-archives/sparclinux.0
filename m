"This change actually doesn't have any effect, and doesn't matter,
 so let's make this change."

I really don't buy this.

I'd also rather the kernel use Kconfig based symbols to detect for
arch availability of feature X or Y, assuming things are CPP symbols
is very fragile at best.

I'm not applying this, sorry.  I mean, you didn't even bother to
mention what symbol this does matter for.
