I -think- it has it... Pismo definitely has one of the first variant of
UniNorth with "working" FW afaik.

The first UniNorth was used in the first "toilet-seat" ibook, but I
think this one didn't have firewire, or a non-working one... and in the
first Sawtooth G4 for which FW and Ethernet even were separate PCI chips
because the ones in UniNorth were too broken.

It's possible that early G4 titanium powerbooks or other model of FW
iBooks have that UniNorth FW variant too.

Ben.
