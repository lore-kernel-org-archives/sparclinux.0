Hmmm, series fails to build on sparc32, and doesn't appear to be
fully bisectable.  Patches 1-3 compile file.  Adding patch 4 gives
the following build error.  Missing include perhaps?

/home/grant/hacking/linux-2.6/drivers/of/pdt.c: In function 'build_one_prop':
/home/grant/hacking/linux-2.6/drivers/of/pdt.c:80: error: implicit declaration of function 'prom_firstprop'

make[3]: *** [drivers/of/pdt.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/of] Error 2
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

And after applying patch 5, I get this instead:

cc1: warnings being treated as errors
/home/grant/hacking/linux-2.6/arch/sparc/kernel/prom_common.c: In function 'prom_common_nextprop':
/home/grant/hacking/linux-2.6/arch/sparc/kernel/prom_common.c:144: error: passing argument 2 of 'prom_nextprop' discards qualifiers from pointer target type

make[2]: *** [arch/sparc/kernel/prom_common.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

And applying the subsequent patches fails with the same error.
Sparc64 builds fine with the entire stack applied, but I haven't
bisected and I suspect that patch 4 will still fail there.

So, I'll leave patches 1-3 in my tree, and drop 4-7 until you get it
sorted out.

I'm not a fan of global hooks and I personally feel that having to
resort to them is usually failure in architecture.  That said, I'm
beginning to worry that the alternative will require a non-trivial
refactoring of the proc devicetree code.

I had hoped that it would be as simple as deferring the init call, but
I started pulling at that thread, and I suspect the proc devicetree
has some rather important ordering issues that I don't fully
appreciate yet.  I also suspect that some of the logic to keep the
live tree and the proc tree synchronized is scattered outside of the
core OF code.  Blech.  I'm still investigating, but please include
patch 8 when you repost to resolve the build issue.
