Indeed, although this machine typically had non-modular kernels, I
compiled one for these tests.

For now I have only tested the new stack with a 6 year old 1.8" disk
and everything works, including suspend to RAM. The kernel is 2.6.25-rc4
plus additional pull from linux1394-2.6.git: 2.6.25-rc4-00032-g8d36ba4.

Thanks a lot.

P.S: it seems that something broke in the APM emulation around rc2
on this machine, battery level reads at -1% from /proc/apm.

I have never used suspend to disk on this machine. Suspend to RAM
failed when ieee1394 was loaded (or built-in) since 2.6.22 or so. 

For now I have only tested the new stack with a 6 year old 1.8" disk
and everything works, including suspend to RAM. The kernel is 2.6.25-rc4
plus additional pull from linux1394-2.6.git: 2.6.25-rc4-00032-g8d36ba4.

Thanks a lot.
