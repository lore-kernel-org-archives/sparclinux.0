That's the thing, we can't reasonably expect every table to add an entry into
table.h, this should be up to each user. Moving it to tables.h just prolongs
what needs to be done. In this case the change is justifiable given kprobe
annotations are required for some architectures early in architecture code, and
including compiler.h on early architecture code blows up. There is no easy fix
to this, and this this was *actually* the cleanest solution I could devise
without much changes.
