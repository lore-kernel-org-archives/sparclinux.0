Hi

So I tried the patch and found out that the corruption happens in 
setup_command_line --- the first strcpy call corrupted the migratetype 
map.

Examining the problem further, it turned out that Johannes Weiner 
committed new bootmem allocator to 2.6.27-rc1 and the allocator is broken.

This is the minimal sequence that jams the allocator:

void *p, *q, *r;
p = alloc_bootmem(PAGE_SIZE);
q = alloc_bootmem(64);
free_bootmem(p, PAGE_SIZE);
p = alloc_bootmem(PAGE_SIZE);
r = alloc_bootmem(64);

--- after this sequence (assuming that the allocator was empty or 
page-aligned before), pointer "q" will be equal to pointer "r".

What's hapenning inside the allocator:
p = alloc_bootmem(PAGE_SIZE);
in allocator: last_end_off = PAGE_SIZE, bitmap contains bits 10000...
q = alloc_bootmem(64);
in allocator: last_end_off = PAGE_SIZE + 64, bitmap contains 11000...
free_bootmem(p, PAGE_SIZE);
in allocator: last_end_off = PAGE_SIZE + 64, bitmap contains 01000...
p = alloc_bootmem(PAGE_SIZE);
in allocator: last_end_off = PAGE_SIZE, bitmap contains 11000...
r = alloc_bootmem(64);
and now:
it finds bit "2", as a place where to allocate (sidx)
it hits the condition
if (bdata->last_end_off && PFN_DOWN(bdata->last_end_off) + 1 = sidx))
start_off = ALIGN(bdata->last_end_off, align);
--- you can see that the condition is true, so it assigns start_off = 
ALIGN(bdata->last_end_off, align); --- that is PAGE_SIZE --- and allocates 
over already allocated block.

This patch fixes it (kernels 2.6.27-rc2 and 2.6.27-rc3 boot ok after the 
patch). Johannes, please review the patch and submit it to Linus.

With the patch it tries to continue at the end of previous allocation only 
if the previous allocation ended in the middle of the page.
