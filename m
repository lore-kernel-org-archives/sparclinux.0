With separate count and owner, there are timing windows where the two
values are inconsistent. That can cause problem when trying to figure
out the exact state of the rwsem. For instance, a RT task will stop
optimistic spinning if the lock is acquired by a writer but the owner
field isn't set yet. That can be solved by combining the count and
owner together in a single atomic value.

On 32-bit architectures, there aren't enough bits to hold both.
64-bit architectures, however, can have enough bits to do that. For
x86-64, the physical address can use up to 52 bits. That is 4PB of
memory. That leaves 12 bits available for other use. The task structure
pointer is also aligned to the L1 cache size. That means another 6 bits
(64 bytes cacheline) will be available. Reserving 2 bits for status
flags, we will have 16 bits for the reader count.  That can supports
up to (64k-1) readers.

The owner value will still be duplicated in the owner field for the
purpose of signalling that the task is in the process of acquiring or
releasing a rwsem.

This change is currently for x86-64 only. Other 64-bit architectures may
be enabled in the future if the need arises.

With a locking microbenchmark running on 5.0 based kernel, the total
locking rates (in kops/s) of the benchmark on a 4-socket 56-core
x86-64 system before and after the patch were as follows:

                  Before Patch      After Patch
   # of Threads  wlock    rlock    wlock    rlock
   ------------  -----    -----    -----    -----
        1        29,085   30,179   27,892   29,514
        2         7,341   14,084    6,240   14,304
        4         7,393   14,246    5,216   11,754
        8         7,139   13,860    5,400   11,308
       16         6,650   15,773    5,744   15,405

This change does have an impact on both read and write lock performance.
