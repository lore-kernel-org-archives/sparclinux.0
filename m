Sure, I will remove zero boolean argument from 
memblock_virt_alloc_internal(), and do memset() calls inside callers.

OK, I will think about this.

I do not really like adding new configs because they tend to clutter the 
code. This is why, I wanted to rely on already existing config that I 
know benefits all platforms that use it. Eventually, 
"CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT" is going to become the default 
everywhere, as there should not be a drawback of using it even on small 
machines.
