I assume you use this device for your too filesystem, in which case
the firmware has to be in the initial ramdisk.

The qla2xxx firmware isn't in the firmware tree, it's in the filesystem
somewhere, and that gets put into the initial ramdisk you build for
a particular kernel image.  For this reason CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
won't make any difference.

This takes a bit of skill to get working properly, I hate it too.  It's
really unfriendly to users and even kernel developers.  These drivers
should "just work" when you build them, rather than require contortions
such as this.
