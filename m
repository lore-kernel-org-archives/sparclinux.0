Thanks.

There is only partial integration at the moment, but filling
that gap is certainly planned.

Thanks I've done that.

As others noted the SPI layer does have this already.  I converted
esp.c to use them, thanks.

I did all of this, and it's fine, but there is one site which is much
less pleasant, device reconnect.

With the esp_target_data->lun[] mapping the lookup during device
reconnect was O(1), now I have to use __scsi_device_lookup_by_target()
which is O(num_active_luns).

In fact the efficiency of that lookup was why I did the data
structures the way I did in the first place.

But anyways this is cleaner for now and I doubt it matters for
the setups people have with this chip.

Ok I'll remove that, thanks.

Done.

Agreed, and done.

Hmmm, OK.  But which of those two error codes should I use?

Actually I don't think it's avoidable.  I set cmd_per_lun to "2"
and in this way when a command completes I'll always be able to
immediately issue another command for the same device even if
disconnect is disabled.

Otherwise I have to wait for the softirq to run (after ->scsi_done())
and then the scsi mid-layer to feed me another command.  Meanwhile
the scsi bus will be idle when it could be instead running commands.

That is the reason behind this.  It's not simply for queueing up at
->queuecommand().  FWIW, I learned this technique from the aic7xxx
driver :-)

I don't want to have to edit N source files if I want to tweak
the quickirq logic.

unique_id is only 32-bits, the MMIO address on sparc64 systems often
only differ in the upper 32bits, in fact I do remember one big sparc64
box where the ESP register addresses only differed like that.

That's why I implemented it this way, I did look at other drivers
and consider going the MMIO route but I simply can't :-)

Ok.

Ok.  Actually ssleep() seems even more appropriate :-)  So that's
what I'll use.

Ok.

For sure. :)

Thanks for all of your comments.  I'll repost the driver patch
again in a few days in order to let some more feedback come in.
