Good catch, my current implementation did break this and is now fixed.

I will add a note about the ordering problem to the manpage as well.
Unfortunately, the basic idea of clearing VM_LOCKED from mm->def_flags
if MCL_FUTURE is not specified but not doing the same for MCL_CURRENT
predates the move to git, so I am not sure if it was ever different.
