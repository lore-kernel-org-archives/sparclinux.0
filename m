After thinking about this a bit, I wonder if we might be better served
with a new set of OA2_* flags instead of repurposing the O_* flags?

Yes, those flags are familiar, but this is an entirely new syscall. We
have a chance to make a fresh start. Does something like O_LARGEFILE
have any real place in openat2? I'd argue no.

Also, once you want to add a new flag, then we get into the mess of how
to document whether open/openat also support it. It'd be good to freeze
changes on those syscalls and aim to only introduce new functionality in
openat2.

That would also allow us to drop some flags from openat2 that we really
don't need, and maybe expand the flag space to 64 bits initially, to
allow for expansion into the future.

Thoughts?

Hmm, there is no version field. When you want to expand this in the
future, what is the plan? Add a new flag to indicate that it's some
length?
