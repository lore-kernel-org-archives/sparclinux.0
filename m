Yes. As I suggested below, most likely that's better to retain the 
#ifdef __ARCH_HAS_5LEVEL_HACK but change the #ifdef 
__PAGETABLE_PUD_FOLDED by a runtime test of mm_pud_folded(mm)

As pointed by Gerald, some arches don't have __PAGETABLE_PUD_FOLDED 
because they are deciding dynamically if they fold the level on not, but 
have mm_pud_folded(mm)

I understand that __ARCH_HAS_5LEVEL_HACK is an HACK as its name 
suggests, so you can't expect all platforms to go for an HACK. I think 
you can keep a single #ifdef __ARCH_HAS_5LEVEL_HACK / #else / #endif and 
put all relevant tests inside it.

For things like __PAGETABLE_PXX_FOLDED dependancies, I still think that 
they can all be replaced by a runtime test of mm_pxx_folded().

Can you try that and see what problem remains ?

Based on the above, that might be the approach to take, yes.
