This is also acceptable, but I don't think you'd really need a special
header flag. Just pass it, and also pass /dev/fd/%d or
/proc/self/fd/%d in argv[]. If the interpreter supports it, everything
works fine. If not, it still works as long as /proc is mounted, but
with a partial fd leak. (Note: the leak is not so bad since the
interpreter would inherit a close-on-exec fd and thus would not leak
it further.)

Aside from setting up the new auxv entry, the main trick the kernel
would have to do is bypassing FD_CLOEXEC at exec time while keeping
the FD_CLOEXEC flag present on the fd after exec.
