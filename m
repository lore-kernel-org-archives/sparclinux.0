Please don't do this kind of patches - it doesn't bring any advantage 
but can create tons of patch conflicts.

The next time a defconfig gets updated it will anyway automatically be 
fixed, and for defconfigs that aren't updated it doesn't create any 
problems to keep them as they are today until they might one day get 
updated.
