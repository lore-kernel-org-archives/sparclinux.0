In that case I would expect the device to go away too. Once the memory
controller goes away, the PCI bus connected to it cannot continue to
function.

Ugh, so I disagree with that notion. cpu_to_node() mapping should be
fixed, you simply cannot change it after boot, too much stuff relies on
it.

Setting cpu_to_node to -1 on node offline is just wrong. But alas, it
seems this is already so.
