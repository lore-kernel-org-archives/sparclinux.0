... except that this won't work these days (once upon a time it used
to, but that had been a long time ago).  However, that doesn't change
the fact that the test is really wrong.  So let's do it right:

* set a new flag along with LOOKUP_JUMPED in nd_jump_link()
* clear it in get_link() right before
	res = READ_ONCE(inode->i_link);
* check it in trailing_symlink() (or callers thereof)

The rest of comments stand, AFAICS.
