Oh no we can't "retire" as in remove the flag, ever. Just not continue 
the way of mmap() flags related to mlock().

I'm not convinced, but it's not a major issue.

I'm somewhat sceptical about the security one. Are security sensitive 
buffers that large to matter? The performance one is more convincing and 
I don't see a better way, so OK.
