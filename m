Hm, I decide to drop weak arch_find_msi_chip(), no one likes it.
Let's find a better solution :)

Yes, PCI hostbridge driver find the matched msi chip during its initialization,
and assign the msi chip to PCI bus in pcibios_add_bus().

So I think maybe save msi chip in PCI arch sysdata is a good candidate.
