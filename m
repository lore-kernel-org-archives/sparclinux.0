In implementation /proc/self/exe is a named rather than a numbered file
descriptor.  Essentially when loading an elf executable the file
descriptor is duped to the name /proc/self/exe.  The implementation
otherwise is the same as /proc/self/fd/N.

The downside of course is that I expect if we were actually to change
/proc/self/exe from to point at the script instead of the shell some
piece of software somewhere would come melting down.  I am totally not
ready to consider that kind of mine field today.
