Here is version 3 of my gdb helper scripts. Changes in this release are
related to improving compatibility with older gdb versions (down to 7.1)
and the with latest one (7.5). Also, proper reloading of updated kernel
and module symbols was implemented.

Andrew, I got the suggestion to pass these patches through your hands.
Could you take them?


Here is the original intro for reference:

This adds the infrastructure and first tools that make kernel debugging
through gdb more comfortable. Since 7.0, gdb supports python scripting.
And this opens the doors to automate steps like the tedious loading of
module symbols at the right address, resolving per-cpu variables or even
retrieving the current kernel log without resuming an stopped target.

Many of the helpers naturally depend on the layout of structures or
internal mechanics of the kernel. So the best place to maintain such
things, keeping them consistent with the corresponding kernel is, well,
the kernel itself.

While these scripts have been originally developed for debugging via
QEMU/KVM, I've now also added the required bits for KGDB. Works fine,
but as QEMU/KVM tends to outperform KGDB it remains the recommendation
- when available.

There are two architecture dependencies so far, one regarding per-cpu,
the other regarding thread_info calculation. None of them I was able to
test on a target, so I'm counting on review/testing by the corresponding
communities.

This series should be considered the foundation of much more kernel
state exploration helpers, e.g. around tasks, timers, locks, sockets -
I guess people will have even more ideas.

Hope it's useful!
