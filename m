At runtime, it's obviously a lot harder to resolve.  However, that's not
what we're trying to do with this patch.

The main issue is that Laura is trying to add SG chain support to ARM64.
At the moment, ARM64 uses the asm-generic version of scatterlist.h
directly.

Her first spin of the patch involved creating
arch/arm64/include/asm/scatterlist.h, which was nothing more than an
include of the asm-generic header file of the same name, and the
definition of ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN.  That seemed to be extremely wasteful
and sub-optimal way to handle this.

Moving this symbol into the Kconfig means that ARM64 no longer has to
have this additional file (and probably a bunch of other architectures
fall into that same camp) and the ARM specific CONFIG_ARM_HAS_SG_CHAIN
can be eliminated in favour of the now generic cross-arch config symbol.

We have plenty of other Kconfig symbols which control similar features
throughout the kernel source, there is no reason that this one should
not be the same.
