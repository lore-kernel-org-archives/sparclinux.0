IIRC having page PageMlocked and put on unevictable list isn't necessary 
to prevent it from being reclaimed. It's just to prevent it from being 
scanned for reclaim in the first place. When attempting to unmap the 
page, vma flags are still checked, see the code in try_to_unmap_one(). 
You should probably extend the checks to your new VM_ flag as it is done 
for VM_LOCKED and then you shouldn't need to walk the pages to mlock 
them (although it would probably still be better for the accounting 
accuracy).
