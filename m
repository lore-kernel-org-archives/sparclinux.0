I think it's already explicit enough that the user calls mlock2(), no? 
He obviously wants the range mlocked. An optional flag says that there 
should be no pre-fault.

I guess users not caring about MLOCK_ONFAULT will continue using plain 
mlock() without flags anyway.

Yeah that would remove the weird 4-states-of-which-2-are-invalid problem 
I mentioned, but at the cost of glibc wrapper behaving differently than 
the kernel syscall itself. For little gain.

Hm it's similar but not exactly the same, because MCL_FUTURE is not the 
same as MLOCK_ONFAULT :) So MLOCK_CURRENT would be even more confusing. 
Especially if mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) is OK, but 
mlock2(MLOCK_LOCKED | MLOCK_ONFAULT) is invalid.

I don't want to NAK that patch if you think it's useful.
