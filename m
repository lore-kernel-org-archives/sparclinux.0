Thanks for sticking with this.  Adding new syscalls is a bit of a
hassle but I do think we end up with a better interface - the existing
mlock/munlock/mlockall interfaces just aren't appropriate for these
things.

I don't know whether these syscalls should be documented via new
manpages, or if we should instead add them to the existing
mlock/munlock/mlockall manpages.  Michael, could you please advise?
