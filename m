Hi everyone,

there is a potential bug with KVM and hugetlbfs if the hardware does not
support hugepages (EDAT1).
We fix this by making EDAT1 a hard requirement for hugepages and 
therefore removing and simplifying code.

As s390, with the sw-emulated hugepages, was the only user of arch_prepare/release_hugepage
I also removed theses calls from common and other architecture code.

Thanks,
    Dominik
