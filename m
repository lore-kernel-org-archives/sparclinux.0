Sure, will do.

Will do.

Sure, will update except the 'kernel module' part. Thank you.

Its not a kernel module any more, my bad that the description has still these
words left on from previous versions, will fix it. The test now gets invoked
through a late_initcall().

Gerald Schaefer had reported earlier about a bug found on s390 with this test.

At minimum we need buddy allocator to be initialized for the allocations to
work. Just after pgtable_init() or kmem_cache_init() in mm_init() will be a
good place ?

Not sure whether I got this. Why would you expect it to context switch ?

All the configs with respect to memory debugging is generated from
lib/Kconfig.debug after fetching all that is in "mm/Kconfig.debug".
There are only three configs which depend on CONFIG_DEBUG_VM like
a package.

1. CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_VMACACHE
2. CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_RB
3. CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS
4. CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE [proposed for this]

Before that, just trying to understand whether the reason of making this
arch page table test as part of DEBUG_VM_* package than a just a stand
alone config as many others, is that it is directly related to virtual
memory enablement in kernel. Or is there something else I am missing.

But this looks better and will make this depend on a selectable arch
config like ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE or something.
