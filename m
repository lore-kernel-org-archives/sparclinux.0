Whilst I don't have access to my reproducer machine until tomorrow in
order to test this myself, I wanted to toss this patch your way so you
could get a head start on me.

The issue is not that gcc-4.9 miscompiles anything, the issue is that
we had an existing bug that is exposed by gcc-4.9 simply allocating
registers in a different order.

per_cpu_patch() is the function that matters.  I verified this by
pulling that function out of setup_64.c and into it's own separate
foo.c file, and only building that source file with gcc-4.9

I poured over the assembler several times over the course of a day or
so, and I'm pretty sure the generated code is fine.  I even extracted
the assembler into a userland test-case and stepped through it for
the code paths that Ultra-III systems trigger.

What happens is that the inner-most registers are corrupted by the
first one of the TLB misses triggered by this code patching.  These
TLB misses are serviced by the firmware because we are still using the
firmware's trap table this early on, and if the code path in the
firmware to service that TLB miss is deep enough we get a register
spill.

This is the top-most of the initial kernel stack's call chain, the
per_cpu_patch() function is invoked right from head_64.S.

What we've traditionally done is save away the firmware's stack
pointer, and jump onto that stack when we make firmware calls.  But
there is absolutely no reason to do that, and it means that by doing
so we have always risked modifying registers erroneously at that
boundary at the top of the initial kernel stack.

So let's get rid of the CIF stack, and just call into the firwmare
using the normal kernel stack.
