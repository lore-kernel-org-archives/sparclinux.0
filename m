I have decided to break the rwsem patchset that I sent out on last
Thursday into 3 parts. This patch is part 0 as it touches a number of
arch specific files and so have the widest distribution. I would like to
get it merged first. Part 1 will be patches 1-10 (except 4) of my
original rwsem patchset. This part moves things around, adds more
debugging capability and lays the ground work for the next part. Part 2
will contains the remaining patches which are the real beef of the whole
patchset.

Cheers,
Longman
