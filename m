I have some changes I'd like to make to our syscall table that will
clash with this.

I'll try and send them today.

We already have a gap at 366-377 from when we tried to add the split IPC
calls a few years back.

I guess I don't mind leaving that gap and using the common numbers as
you've done here.

But it would be good to add a comment pointing out that we have room
at 366 for more arch specific syscalls as well.

cheers
