I'll try to explain this more.

Jeesh, OK, will give it one more go.

Hell no, the gain here is clear annotation of when this practice is used.
Linker table use could make this practice more prevalent.

Compile testing is one easy way, but better yet understanding the code is
best. The structural change complication was one consideration that came
to mind.

We could fold it under that, sure.

Alright, I'll rip all this code bit rot things out into its own separate
patch for Kbuild changes, documentation, etc, and see if this helps. Otherwise
we can evaluate if we should just drop it. Keep in mind that iPXE actually
used it for this purpose and enabled it tree wide, since I knew it would
likely not be a popular option for some I figured an optional build target
would be better. The rest is up to me to try to explain then how and why some
folks might want this. Linker tables just make it an easier practice to
use due to the simplication of code from #ifdef statements on Kconfig
symbols.

I'll address all this then separately in my next respin. It will be its own
separate patch.
