Note: the commit message is "broken, but working, ptregs system call
conversion for x86-64".

The "but working" is not because it would be right, but because it
booted a real 64-bit distribution successfully, and I actually used
that kernel.

But that only tests the native 64-bit case, it in no way tests the
compat or x32 cases what-so-ever. That part was literally a "it
compiles - it must be perfect" with absolutely zero testing of even
the most trivial kind.

And it really would have been most trivial to just do a "Hello world"
and build it with "-m32". I didn't do even that, and if I had, I would
have been honestly surprised had it worked.

But there was a _theoretical_ chance that it could have worked. Maybe.
