Start your bisect with the change right before this one:

commit a2fb23af1c31ad6e0c281e56d385f803229d57fa
Author: David S. Miller <davem@sunset.davemloft.net>
Date:   Wed Feb 28 23:35:04 2007 -0800

    [SPARC64]: Probe PCI bus using OF device tree.
    
    Almost entirely taken from the 64-bit PowerPC PCI code.
    
    This allowed to eliminate a ton of cruft from the sparc64
    PCI layer.
    
    Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

Unfortunately, if the tree works right before this change,
you can't just add this one because a subsequent fix is
needed before ultra5/ultra10 will work again, but it's
this one:

commit 01f94c4a6ced476ce69b895426fc29bfc48c69bd
Author: David S. Miller <davem@ultra5.davemloft.net>
Date:   Sun Mar 4 12:53:19 2007 -0800

    [SPARC64]: Fix sabre pci controllers with new probing scheme.
 ...

So you could test these two commits:

deb66c4521e119442aa266553e8cbfc86eb71232
a2fb23af1c31ad6e0c281e56d385f803229d57fa

Thanks.
