Part 2/7 of "proc: move procfs to what kernfs does", on top of part 1:

  https://patch.msgid.link/20261104-work-procfs-v2-0-b45cd5789ac5@brauner

remove_proc_entry() waits until every call into the entry has returned.
A seq_file entry wait across seq_read_iter() including the copy to
userspace. Non-seq_file entries wait across ->proc_read(),
->proc_write() and ->proc_ioctl(), which copy to and from userspace
as well.

A reader or writer can abuse a page fault to make copy take as long as
it wants. For example, by using userfaultfd or by punching holes into a
memfd over and over. And callers of remove_proc_entry() like to hold
locks while they wait. For instance, addrconf holds RTNL when it removes
/proc/net/dev_snmp6/<dev> and xt_hashlimit holds hashlimit_mutex which
is shared by all network namespaces.

There was a hackish and very narrow AI solution to a small part of this
bug class which was sent off-list. In essence, it used a second
buffering mechanism on top of seqfiles which was really nasty. It also
didn't address any of the non-seqfile users.

If we want to get rid of the this whole bug class we need a bigger
hammer. That means reworking how procfs handles data. So I tried to work
through all of that.

This changes procfs so the entry's code only ever runs with the entry
pinned and never touches userspace memory. This is the core procfs
change required for this. The entries themselves are converted in four
series on top of it. The are independent of each other. The last series
drops all __user methods.

* seq_file reads

  procfs owns the seq_file and only calls into the entry with it pinned.
  An entry declares its seq_operations, or just a show function, and the
  size of its private state in struct proc_ops. procfs opens and frees
  the seq_file and reads and seeks through seq_file directly.

  ->proc_open() and ->proc_release() only deal with whatever the entry
  needs on top of that. proc_create_seq() and friends already keep the
  seq_operations in the entry so they're switched over in one go here.
  That covers most of /proc/net.

  The open coded single_open() and seq_open() users that don't do
  anything else are converted with a coccinelle script. A nice side
  effect is that opening one of these entries no longer allocates a
  pde_opener as they have no ->proc_release() of their own anymore.

* Writes

  procfs copies in what is written before it pins the entry and hands
  the entry a NUL-terminated kernel copy through ->proc_write_buf().

  The copy is capped at PAGE_SIZE - 1 bytes unless the entry asks for
  more in ->proc_write_size.

  Entries that take binary data in pieces (the PCI config space, ALSA's
  data entries, cio_ignore and the rtas flash files) ask for
  PROC_ENTRY_SHORT_WRITES and their writes come up short.

  Since procfs copies in the whole write first, a write that is too
  large or whose buffer can't be read fails before the entry's own
  checks now.

* Reads that don't go through seq_file

  An entry fills a kernel buffer in ->proc_read_buf(), procfs copies
  that to userspace after unpinning the entry and only moves the
  position if that copy worked, like kernfs_file_read_iter().

  The buffer is a page unless the entry asks for more in
  ->proc_read_size, and like with kernfs a larger read comes up short.

  Entries whose readers want all of a large file in one read,
  /proc/vmcore, /proc/config.gz and ALSA's data entries, ask for
  PROC_ENTRY_FULL_READS and procfs fills their reads in pieces. These
  entries are read through ->read_iter() now, so sendfile() and splice()
  work for them.

* ioctls

  The command number doesn't reliably say what an ioctl copies. The PCI
  ioctls aren't encoded at all, i8k's encode the wrong sizes and esas2r
  uses a range of plain numbers.

  So an entry lists its commands in ->proc_ioctl_args with what goes in
  and what comes back out. That works like DRM's ioctl tables.

  procfs copies the argument in before it pins the entry, calls
  ->proc_ioctl_buf() with that copy and copies it back out after
  unpinning the entry.

  A command that isn't in the table fails with -ENOTTY. 32-bit tasks go
  through the same table, so the compat hooks go away.

* permanent entries

  Entries that are never removed, kcore, kmsg and the kpage files, keep
  reading straight into userspace. The last series gives them
  file_operations of their own and takes the __user methods out of
  struct proc_ops altogether.

* mmap()

  procfs pins the entry around ->proc_mmap() and then wraps the
  vm_operations of the mapping the way kernfs does. So the entry's
  ->fault(), ->page_mkwrite(), ->access() and ->open() run pinned as
  well.

  Removing the entry unmaps the mappings in its own address space, like
  kernfs does, and a fault into one of them is SIGBUS from then on.

  A file that maps through another address space, /proc/bus/pci through
  the one of /dev/mem, keeps its mappings like a sysfs resource file
  does. The entry's vm_operations live in its open node. vmcore's
  mappings of the old memory no longer outlive fadump releasing it.

* Poll

  An entry with a ->proc_poll() used to sleep its pollers on a wait
  queue of its own and procfs only pinned the entry around the call.

  The poller stays on that queue after the call, so after
   remove_proc_entry() ran ->proc_release() on the still open file and
   the owner freed the queue with the rest.

   sunrpc kept the queue of its channel files in the per-namespace
   cache_detail, so a poll() across the end of the namespace was a
   use-after-free. md works around the same thing at unload by waking
   its pollers in a loop until nobody is left.

   Make procfs own the wait queue. It lives in the open node,
   proc_reg_poll() does the poll_wait() on it before it calls the
   method. The owner wakes the pollers with proc_poll_notify(), and a
   poll of a removed entry reports EPOLLERR | EPOLLPRI.

   The seven pollable entries in the tree move over in the conversion
   series.

   The last series takes the poll_table away from ->proc_poll() once
   nothing needs it anymore.

* Lockdep

  The pin is a read lock to lockdep and a removal takes the write side
  around waiting for the last user, the way kernfs annotates its active
  reference.

  A method that takes a lock while pinned and a removal under that lock
  is the deadlock xt_recent had, and lockdep reports it now instead of a
  reviewer having to find it.

  The class is per kind of entry, keyed on the seq_operations or
  proc_ops the entries of a kind share, and per registration site for
  the entries that only share a show function, like sysfs keys per
  attribute.

On a KASAN and lockdep kernel the reader selftest fails without the
series and passes with it, and the mapped-entry selftest, run against
a virtio-rng device in a VM, fails without the mmap patch and passes
with it. The other proc selftests behave the same with and without the
series and so do the entries converted here that I could get at in a
VM.

Changes in v2:
- the open files of an entry live in an open node that only entries with
  a release or mmap hook get, a removal waits with wait_var_event(), the
  readdir cursor is shared with sysctl
- procfs pins the entry around the vm_operations of its mappings and
  unmaps a removed entry's own address space like kernfs does, with a
  selftest; a file that maps through another address space,
  /proc/bus/pci through the one of /dev/mem, keeps its mappings like a
  sysfs resource file; vmcore's mappings of the old memory no longer
  outlive fadump releasing it
- lockdep checks the pin
- procfs owns the wait queue of an entry with a ->proc_poll(), the
  conversions are in the area series
- the seq_file runs the entry's own ->next() and ->show() with procfs's
  ->start() and ->stop() around them instead of a wrapper per record,
  which cost up to 24% on /proc/vmstat, and the ERR_PTR(-EIO) sentinel
  is gone
- ioctls that only pass a value no longer copy to a NULL pointer
  (-EFAULT on csky), and registration also refuses a
  ->proc_compat_ioctl() next to ->proc_ioctl_buf()
- rebased onto v7.4-rc1
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20261102-work-procfs-core-v1-0-75df35e4f8b8@kernel.org
