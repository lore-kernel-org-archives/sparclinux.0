actually USERCOPY has never been about validating pointers. its sole purpose
is to validate the *size* argument of copy*user calls, a very specific form
of runtime bounds checking. it's only really relevant for slab objects and the
pointer checks (that one might mistake for being a part of the defense mechanism)
are only there to determine whether the kernel pointer refers to a slab object
or not (the stack part is a small bonus and was never the main goal either).

yes, more bikeshedding will surely help, like the renaming of .data..read_only
to .data..ro_after_init which also had nothing to do with init but everything
to do with objects being conceptually read-only...

what kind of checks are you thinking of here? and more fundamentally, against
what kind of threats? as for memcpy, it's the standard mandated memory copying
function, what security related properties can it check on its pointer arguments?
