I'm definitely fine with not reusing them ever, and jumping from 511 to
548 when we get there on all architectures, if you think that helps.

While we could also jump to 548 *now*, I think that would be a
bit wasteful. Syscall numbers are fairly cheap, but not entirely
free, especially when you consider architectures like mips that
have an upper bound of 1000 syscalls before they have to get
inventive.
