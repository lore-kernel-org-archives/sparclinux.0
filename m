The way llvm generates stack access is:
rX = r10
rX += imm
and that's the only thing verifier recognizes as valid ptr_to_stack.
Like rX -= imm will not be recognized as proper stack offset,
since llvm never does it.
I guess that counts as ALU on FP ?
Looks like we don't have such tests in test_bpf.ko. Hmm.
Pretty much all compiled C code should have such stack access.
The easiest test is tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_progs

That check was added to x64 JIT, because JIT patches were submitted
before eBPF was known to user space. There was no verifier at that time.
So JIT had do some checking, just for sanity.
It's probably ok to remove it now... or leave it as-is as historical artifact.
