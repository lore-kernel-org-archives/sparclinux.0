A known working workaround (used in tracepoints for a few years) is to align the
type declaration on 32 bytes. It wastes space, but works. With this solution,
you should remove all the per-variable alignment attributes.

Now what I'm discussing with David Miller is if creating a

  __long_packed_aligned

and using it for *both* type and variable alignment would be more palatable (it
also works, and is more compact).

David proposed a solution with an array of pointers (extra indirection) which I
don't really like for 3 reasons I exposed in my reply to him.

So it's not that the solution is not in our grasp yet, it's more that we have to
choose the right one.

Thanks,

Mathieu
