I was (and still am) a bit unsure about this one. A number of architectures
added the numbers that won't ever support them, but I wasn't sure if
any of those that didn't add them might need it later.

I tried to just go by the rule that anything that we list in
asm-generic/unistd.h
is probably important enough that we want to list it everywhere, even if
that includes a couple that we end up being rather architecture specific.

I'm happy to drop this patch if you or others feel that we're better off
without it though.
