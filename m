Documentation is good, but not necessary to have the extra name indirection.
Sections tend (not always, but it would be nice if they did) to follow the
.name convention, which makes them reasonably easy to grep for. They are also
the names you'll be grepping for when you look at disassembly.

But follows is not the same as combined. And together with the comment that
RODATA is for code (which is wrong, it's data), it make it seem like it
is actually combined.

Right, I wasn't talking about arch implementation of how the ro
protection is done, so much as just the comments being a bit misleading.

I think comments are one of the key features of this patch series (or at
least this patch, I've not looked through the others so much yet). I'm no
expert on linker stuff, but I think a lot of arch maintainers aren't
necessarily either so you tend to get a lot of copy and paste without
always people knowing what exactly is happening. It would be really good
to have some longer explanations and justifications/examples IMO. So I
don't think that would be controversial if you wanted to expand on it.

Right, it's just that .text.* is *immediately* obvious. SECTION_ALL() is not.

I don't know... not to be glib, but .section.* would be better and not require
documentation.

CORE does not really add anything as far as I can see. Other types of .text including
ones which are automatically generated by the compiler, for better or worse, are
.text.x sections too.

I would like to see more standardisation of naming convention -- some sections start
with .., some start with no dots, some use . to separate logical "subsections", others
use underscores or something else. I just don't see it would be a problem to simply
use the raw names and linker wildcards for it.

BTW, I'm not trying to bikeshed :) This doesn't affect the value of your
patch at all, it was just an offhand thing I saw.

It's fine, I don't mind too much. I think asm-generic/asm.h should be
fine for generic asm'isms though. Or assembler.h to match compiler.h.

Well but your macros are not linker sections. They are "Linux sections", which
appear to give you a start and end symbol name, but does not direct the linker
to create a specific output section. I just can't work out what exactly is a
"custom Linux section", and what DECLARE_LINUX_SECTION(), for example, actaully
gives you.
