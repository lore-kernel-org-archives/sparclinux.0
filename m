Indeed, thanks! In reality this is generalizing custom section hacks, but also
making them much more powerful due to the fact that we sort now at link time,
this buys us better than O(1) sort for code where dependencies can be spelled
out in code, it also expands on the semantics available to us for order
levels -- so we're no longer restricted to 7 levels for built-in code -- and
order levels can be subject/subsystem specific.
