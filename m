There appears to be no point to the first three hunks of this diff:

(ushort)(x << 16) 
(ushort)(x & 0xffff)

return the same thing whether the type of x is u32 or u64, so there was
no need to alter the original code.

What's the guarantee, since the device descriptors only cope with 32
bits of physical address, that this driver never gets any dma address
beyond its addressable range?  Is it that the sbus can never be
attached to this ATU type IOMMU?  If so, saying that in the log would
be useful.
