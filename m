I did some experiments looking at what happens when the
include/trace/ftrace.h __aligned__(4) usages for _ftrace_events are
changed to __aligned__(8). This causes the R_SPARC_UA64 relocations to
go to R_SPARC_64 and gets rid of that particular issue.

However it does not cause the R_SPARC_13 relocation records to go away.
They still persist and the ones I've looked at are be related to uses of
struct tracepoint that I mentioned earlier. I tried various different
values of alignment for both __ftrace_events and struct tracepoint but
nothing made the uses of R_SPARC_13 go away.

As an example from drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c function scsi_eh_wakeup().

This has relocation records of

0000000000002be0 R_SPARC_HI22      __tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup
0000000000002be4 R_SPARC_LO10      __tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup
0000000000002be4 R_SPARC_13        *ABS*+0x0000000000000008
0000000000002bf4 R_SPARC_LO10      __tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup
0000000000002bf4 R_SPARC_13        *ABS*+0x0000000000000020

for the following assembly code

sethi  %hi(__tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup), %g1   !, tmp135
lduw    [%g1+%lo(__tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup)+8], %g2   ! __tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup.state,
cmp     %g2, 0  ! __tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup.state,
be,pt   %icc, .LL454
nop    !
ldx     [%g1+%lo(__tracepoint_scsi_eh_wakeup)+32], %l0  !, it_func_ptr
brz,pn  %l0, .LL454     ! it_func_ptr,

this corresponds to the first few lines of

void scsi_eh_wakeup(struct Scsi_Host *shost)
{
        if (shost->host_busy = shost->host_failed) {
                trace_scsi_eh_wakeup(shost);
                wake_up_process(shost->ehandler);
                SCSI_LOG_ERROR_RECOVERY(5,
                                printk("Waking error handler thread\n"));
        }
}


If I try compiling with the -Os option removed from KBUILD_CFLAGS it
produces a more traditional R_SPARC_HI22 and R_SPARC_LO10 output as
shown below. So maybe there is a really need to add R_SPARC_13 support
to the sparc64 module loader to allow for the optimizations that the
compiler is making now.
