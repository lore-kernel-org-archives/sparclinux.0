If I understand your objection correctly, you want the above pattern
expressed either like this:

	struct foo *x = rcu_dereference(*ptr);
	x->bar = 5;

Or like this:

	struct foo *x = lockless_dereference(*ptr);
	x->bar = 5;

Or am I missing your point?

And the smp_read_barrier_depends() in both rcu_dereference() and
in lockless_dereference() is ordering the read-to-read case and the
underlying hardware is ordering the read-to-write case on weakly ordered
hardware.

Or, again, am I missing your point?
