Awesome, thanks for working on it! :)

There is samples/bpf/sockex3_kern.c, which exercises it. To
run it, it would be (clang/llvm needed due to BPF backend not
available in gcc):

# cd samples/bpf
# make
# ./sockex3
IP     src.port -> dst.port               bytes      packets
127.0.0.1.12865 -> 127.0.0.1.49711          148            2
127.0.0.1.49711 -> 127.0.0.1.12865          108            2
[...]

Inside parse_eth_proto(), it will do tail calls based on the
eth protocol. Over time, we'll move such C based tests over to
tools/testing/selftests/bpf/.

Makes sense. That would follow the same model as ppc32/64.

On a quick initial glance, you also need to map BPF_REG_AX. If
I understand the convention correctly, you could use L7 for that.

You can test for it through tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_kmod.sh
which exercises the test_bpf.ko under various sysctl combinations as
part of the BPF selftest suite.

Thanks a lot!
