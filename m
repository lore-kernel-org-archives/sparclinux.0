This one needs to be BUG.  It is a *requirement* for the platform to
supply a pkg2path hook.  Although, I think I'll remove this line
anyway; if a new platform doesn't supply the hook, then it isn't even
going to boot, so no point bothering to execute this test for each an
every node in the tree.

Absolutely boot will fail.

I'm adamant on this point.  pkg2path *must* return a value path
string.  If it does not, then the node must not get registered.  I've
taken a look at the sparc code, and it really looks like the
assignment of full_name can be moved into of_pdt_create_node.  None of
the SPARC *_path_component functions seem to depend on the sibling or
allnodes pointers being populated.

I just noticed another potential bug here.  buf is unassigned and
random here.  Even though length is passed as '0', a random value is
effectively getting passed as the buf pointer.  It should be passed as
NULL to avoid any accidents.  Changed in my version of the patch.

If firmware is buggy, then pkg2path must deal with it.  It is not okay
for it to return NULL.  (I know that pkg2path is an OFW command, but
in this context it really means the linux wrapper to pkg2path which
has the semantics, "give me the unique, full and accurate path for
this node").  If OFW pkg2path doesn't work, then the platform code
must work around it.  I'm pushing back on this because I do not want
to see platform workarounds in the common code.

(I'd almost rather see all promtree users adopt the sparc approach of
building up from known data instead of calling into higher level OFW
functions, but that's an orthogonal debate).

*however* if you really want to implement a dp->name fallback, then I
would be okay with something like this:  At least it ensures every
full_path string is unique in the system.

static int broken_unique_id = 0;
sprintf(buf, "%s/%s-broken%i", parent->full_name, dp->name, broken_unique_id++);
pr_err("pkg2path busted; ugly name workaround applied\n");

For now I'm inclined to keep the BUG(), and I'll let you handle any
workarounds in the OLPC code if needed.

If we cannot allocate ram at this point, we've got much bigger
problems.  BUG is appropriate here.... actually, if prom_early_alloc()
cannot provide memory, it should fail hard like sparc prom_64 does.
Care to craft a separate patch to make that change for OLPC?  (for
2.6.39; no rush)

I've pushed the latest version out to my devicetree/experimental
branch on git://git.secretlab.ca/git/linux-2.6.  Give it a spin and
make sure everything is still working for you.
