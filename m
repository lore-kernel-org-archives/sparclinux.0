I see.

Nope, if anything only upon deployment on major distributions due to
some perhaps compatibility thing with custom hacks folks may have carried
and this just ended up clashing with. The only other case I can think
of a need for a change would be if upstream linkers supported something
similar for another brand of section names, with the added gain that
we would then not even need the 2 new lines on the kernel linker script
for section ranges and tables per section.

Getting a report so you can fix something is one reason to have a tool,
having it so you can inspect changes is another. So it depends what uses
there are for objtool. I take it that for this case we do want upstream
objtool to embrace the new section name to avoid further reports as
issues ?

We can open code the string, that's fine. In retrospect since things
won't change often that keeps things simple.
