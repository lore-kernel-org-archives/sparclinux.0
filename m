I don't think the address dependency is enough on its own. By that
reasoning, the following variant (WRC+addr+addr) would work too:


P0:
Wx = 1

P1:
Rx = 1
<address dep>
Wy = 1

P2:
Ry = 1
<address dep>
Rx = 0


So are you saying that this is also forbidden?
Imagine that P0 and P1 are two threads that share a store buffer. What
then?

I tried grepping the linked documents for "coherence manager" but couldn't
find anything. Is the description you refer to available anywhere?
