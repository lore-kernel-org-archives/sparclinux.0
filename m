Definitely yes to 1) and 2), I have a Pismo which I use on a virtually
daily basis (and about to remove the last remnants of MacOS on it). 
However I have disabled Firewire because it would not sleep and wake 
up properly. 

I can test it on Wednesday with a 5GB fireflly disk from 2001.

Please tell me which configuration options I need to set for
Firewire (which stack, etc...).
