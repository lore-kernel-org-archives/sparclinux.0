Unfortunately only for the fake numa case, since as far as I understand it,
parallelization happens only on a node granularity. And since we are
usually only having one node...

But anyway, it won't hurt to set ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT on
s390 also. I'll do some testing and then we'll see.

Pavel, could you please change your patch 5 so it also converts the s390
call sites of vmemmap_alloc_block() so they use VMEMMAP_ZERO instead of
'true' as argument?
