We're uninterested in pagecache and user memory and they should be omitted
from the image (making it enormously smaller too).

That leaves security keys and perhaps filenames, and these could probably
be addressed.

We've had a few more than that, but all the ones I recall actually came
from the kdump developers who were hitting other bugs and who just happened
to know how to drive the thing.

Often we don't even get that: "I was in X and it didn't hit the logs".

You can learn a hell of a lot by really carefully picking through kernel
memory with gdb.
