   ^^^^

Anatoly, I think your LDOM is why you don't see the problem.  Yes, your 
patch works just fine when running in a client LDOM, but we see a 
problem when running this on sparc "bare metal".  Did you test this on 
the bare metal so that the self-test would run?

It seems there's an issue with the self-test in the newer hardware and 
the driver will never stop trying to retest the hardware.  I'm 
contemplating a patch to limit the self-test attempts, at least until we 
can figure out what is the root of the issue.
