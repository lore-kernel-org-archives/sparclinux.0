Well, it's really the IBM "GX" bus but yeah, it could be converted I
suppose. The "special" iommu functions mostly derive from the fact that
the two adapters we are interested in have their own translation
mechanism built-in. The GX bus sits "above" the TCEs used as an iommu on
these systems.

Right but they might grow one ... and people will wonder why it doesn't
work if you remove the above :-)

Same reasoning, however it becomes moot if we convert them to platform.
