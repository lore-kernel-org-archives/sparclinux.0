One Laptop Per Child ships real Open Firmware on its x86 Linux systems, 
of which approximately 2 million have been shipped or ordered.  An ARM 
version, also with OFW, is in the works.  From the standpoint of "number 
of units in the field actually running Linux", I expect that compares 
favorably with SPARC.

That said, I don't particularly like the abbreviation "of" either; I 
abbreviate Open Firmware as "OFW".

I don't mind using "dt_" to apply to device tree things; I think it's 
clearer than "of_".   Ideally, it would be nice to acknowledge the 
historical connection in some way, but confusing nomenclature probably 
is not the way to go about it.
