We have been over the usefulness of this code many times before as the patc=
h is
already in it's V12. Currently it is enabled on arm64, x86 (except PAE), ar=
c and
ppc32. There are build time or runtime problems with other archs which prev=
ent
enablement of this test (for the moment) but then the goal is to integrate =
all
of them going forward. The test not only validates platform's adherence to =
the
expected semantics from generic MM but also helps in keeping it that way du=
ring
code changes in future as well.

The test has already found problems with s390 page table helpers.

Again, not only it validates what exist today but its also a tool to make
sure that all platforms continue adhere to a common agreed upon semantics
as reflected through the tests here.

Debug features or tests in the kernel are used when required. These are nev=
er or
should not be enabled by default. AFAICT this is true even for entire DEBUG=
_VM
packaged tests. Do you have any particular data or precedence to substantia=
te
the fact that this test will be used any less often than the other similar =
ones
in the tree ? I can only speak for arm64 platform but the very idea for this
test came from Catalin when we were trying to understand the semantics for =
THP
helpers while enabling THP migration without split. Apart from going over t=
he
commit messages from the past, there were no other way to figure out how any
particular page table helper is suppose to change given page table entry. T=
his
test tries to formalize those semantics.

Could you be more specific here ? What parts of the test are inefficient ? I
am happy to improve upon the test. Do let me know you if you have suggestio=
ns.

Even though I am not agreeing to your assessment about the usefulness of the
test without any substantial data backing up the claims, the test case in
itself is very much compartmentalized, staying clear from generic MM and
debug_vm_pgtable() is only function executing the test which is getting
called from kernel_init_freeable() path.
