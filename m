Yes, that can be a problem.

One possible solution is to check if the count goes negative. If so,
fail the read lock and make the readers wait in the wait queue until the
count is in positive territory. That effectively reduces the reader
count to 15 bits, but it will avoid the overflow situation. I will try
to add that support into the next version.
