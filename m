There's either something wrong with your explanation or my reading
skills :-)

"There are no memory accesses"
"No L3 cache line is allocated"

You can have one or the other ... either the CPU sends a cacheline-sized
write of zeroes to memory without allocating an L3 cache line (maybe
using the store buffer?), or the CPU allocates an L3 cache line and sets
its contents to zeroes, probably putting it in the last way of the set
so it's the first thing to be evicted if not touched.

Or there's some magic in the memory bus protocol where the CPU gets to
tell the DRAM "hey, clear these cache lines".  Although that's also a
memory access of sorts ...
