Hi Mike,

I had a similar patch I was going to post shortly so can add a bit more
on the advantages of this one.

Beyond cleaning up, it also fixes an issue with a buggy ACPI firmware in which the SRAT
table covers some but not all of the memory in the EFI memory map.  Stealing bits
from the draft cover letter I had for that...
