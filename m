It compiles :-)  You deleted the only uses of scsi_rbuf_{get,put}()
so you can kill those off too.

I don't have the time to setup things for testing this patch on
the qlogicpti hardware I have, but with the scsi_rbuf_{get,put}()
deletion added to the patch I would really like to see this go
into 2.6.24 anyways.

If things explode I'll pick up the pieces.
