So I _really_ don't believe in the equidistant physical device. Physics
just doesn't allow that. Or rather, you can, but then it'll be so slow
it doesn't matter.

The only possible option is equidistant to a _small_ number of nodes,
and if that is a reality, then we should look at that. So far however
it's purely been a hypothetical device.

Because it is 100% guaranteed (we have proof) that BIOS is shit and
doesn't set node affinity for devices that really should have it.

So we're trading a hypothetical shared device vs not reporting actual
BIOS bugs. That's no contest.

Worse, we have virtual devices that have clear node affinity without it
set.

So we're growing shit, allowing bugs, and what do we get in return? Warm
fuzzies is not it.

It can possible be a 3 state:

 - UNKNON; overridden by parent/bus/etc..
   ERROR when still UNKNOWN on register.

 - INVALID; ERROR on devm usage.
   for virtual devices / pure sysfs nodes

 - NO_NODE; may only be set on virtual devices (we can check against PCI
   bus etc..) when there really is no better option.

But I only want to see the NO_NODE crap at the end, after all other
possible avenues have been done.

I'm thinking we should/do create per cpu/node devices for such
distributed stuff. For instance, we create per-cpu clockevent devices
(where appropriate).

Emulated devices are typically slow as heck and should be avoided if at
all possible. I don't see NUMA affinity being important for them.
