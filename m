Please minimize code changes. It breaks git blame and longer patches
are harder to review.

In this specific case, from a readability point of view, I find new functions
that map one-to-one onto the new interfaces also more readable than
deeper nested branches in place.

This structure just holds a timestamp. It does not seem socket specific.
I don't mean to bikeshed the naming point too much, but timeval_ll or
so may be more representative than tying it to a socket.

As for the general naming, xxx64 or xxx2038 are more descriptive than xxx_NEW.
