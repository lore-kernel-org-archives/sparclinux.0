I had gone through and tested with each patch applied individually when
I was performance testing them, and I am fairly certain there wasn't a
bug introduced between any two patches.

The issue that I recall Michal had was the fact that I was essentially
embedding the setting of the reserved page under several layers of
function calls, which would make it harder to remove. I started that
work at about patch 5 which is why I figured I would resend the first
4, and hold off on 5-7 until I can get the reserved bit removal for
hotplug done.

I can probably have the patches ready to go in a couple days. I'll send
updates once linux-next and mmotm with the patches dropped have been
posted.

Thanks.
