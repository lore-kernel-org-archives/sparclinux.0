The branch is predicted not taken, so the fallthrough happens most
often.  And this is optimal for most Niagara parts as taken branches
make the cpu thread yield whereas non-taken branches do not.

But this is such a petty thing to be discussing compared to the substance
of this person's changes.  David, I really wish you wouldn't waste people's
time with this stuff.

Maybe if you had to review hundreds of networking patches every day like
I do, you would start to understand the costs of the interference you
place into the review process when you bring up such small matters like
this all the time.

I'd much rather you review the substance of a person's changes,
because that actually helps things more forward.  If you want to micro
optimize then _do it on your own time_, submit patches that do the
micro optimization, and have it go through the review process like
everyone else's changes.

I very much appreciate your cooperation on this matter.

Thanks.
