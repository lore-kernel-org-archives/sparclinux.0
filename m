There is a change that adds explicit use of set_direct_map() to
hibernate. Currently, in case of arm64 with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n if a
thread was paused when a page was in an "invalid" state hibernate will
access an unmapped data because __kernel_map_pages() will bail out.
After the change set_direct_map_default_noflush() would be used and the
page will get mapped before copy.

This series goal was primarily to separate dependincies and make it
clearer what DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and what SET_DIRECT_MAP are. As it turned
out, there is also some lack of consistency between architectures that
implement either of this so I tried to improve this as well.

Honestly, I don't know if a thread can be paused at the time __vunmap()
left invalid pages, but it could, there is an issue on arm64 with
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and this set fixes it.

__vunmap()
    vm_remove_mappings()
        set_direct_map_invalid()
	/* thread is frozen */
 					safe_copy_page()	
 					    __kernel_map_pages()
						if (!debug_pagealloc())
 					    	    return
 					    do_copy_page() -> fault
