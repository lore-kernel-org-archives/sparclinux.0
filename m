Hi,

I am observing that a machine with a niu card/driver automatically
enables itself and then goes dormant again.

[ 4410.930078] niu 0000:10:00.0 eth4: Link is up at 100Mbit/sec, full duplex
[ 4410.930137] br0: port 4(eth4) entered forwarding state
[ 4410.930156] br0: port 4(eth4) entered forwarding state
[ 4420.957745] niu 0000:10:00.0 eth4: Link is down

The interface itself is marked UP, and is part of a bridge,
if that matters. The kernel version is 3.7.1 on sparc64.

6: eth4: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500
qdisc mq master br0 state DOWN qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:21:28:71:32:5a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::221:28ff:fe71:325a/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

At the same time, eth5, to which a cable+machine _is_ connected,
randomly goes out. At first I thought it might be the connected peer,
but seeing that eth4 randomly does a up-down cycle leads me to assume
that niu is doing a cycle here rather than the peer.

[ 3839.724721] niu 0000:10:00.1 eth5: Link is down
[ 3839.725077] br0: port 5(eth5) entered disabled state
