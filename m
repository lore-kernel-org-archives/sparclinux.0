D'oh!  FWIW, it might be worth putting into Documentation/ somewhere;
basically, what is and what isn't biarch-neutral.

Or arch-neutral, for that matter - it's very close.  The only real
exception, IIRC, is an extra twist on m68k, where int behaves
like x86 long long - its alignment is only half its size, so
sizeof(struct {char c; int x;}) is 6, not 8 as everywhere
else.  Irrelevant for biarch, thankfully (until somebody gets insane
enough to implement 64bit coldfire, kernel port for it *and* biarch
support for m68k binaries on that thing, that is)...
