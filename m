Hi all,

Timing does not apear to be an issue. I have checked all the udelay/msleep 
calls I could find and thoes that get called are delaying by the correct 
delay (4 to 7us > specified value).

I have added some more debugging info and it looks like somthing is 
getting corrupted in the INQUIRY command as it is returning:

   Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]
   Add. Sense: Invalid field in cdb

According a of the SCSI2 Std that I have, this equates to one of the 
following:

 	EVPD set and Vital Product Data not supported
 	EVPD clear and Page Code non-zero
 	Control Field Flag set and Link not set

Looking into the issue a bit further, it turns out the the Sparc32 memset 
is broaken - it does not always set the last byte. As a result, the 
Control Field is set to random value (0xE0 in this case). This explains 
all sorts of odd issues. Next step is to fix memset. I will try again once 
I am sure memset is working.

Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
