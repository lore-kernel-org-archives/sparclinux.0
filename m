The timer broadcasting is obviously broken by the existing reboot unplug
mechanism as the outgoing CPU should remove itself from the broadcast.

Just addressing the broadcast issue is not sufficient as there are tons
of other places which rely on consistency of the various cpu masks.

Well, emphasis on 'if system supports hotplug'. If not, then you are
back to square one. On ARM64 hotplug is selectable by a config option.

So either we mandate HOTPLUG_CPU for SMP and get rid of all the
ifdeffery or we need to have a mechanism which works on !HOTPLUG_CPU as
well.

That whole reboot/shutdown stuff is an unpenetrable mess of notifiers
and architecture hackery, so something generic and understandable is
really required.

Thanks,
