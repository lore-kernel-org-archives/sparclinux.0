All of your good explainations and detail need to go into the text
itself.  Responding to my questions is wonderful, but is not going to
help anyone out who sees the config option for the first time, unless
you change the text there.

I still don't understand, sorry.

As a kernel developer, why do I care about this?  Who should care about
this, a driver developer, subsystem developer, someone adding a syscall,
an arch subsystem developer?

circular logic doesn't work :)

Ok, as a maintainer of a subsystem, I still have no idea what any of
this means.  But maybe I'm just don't understand kernel subsystem
development...

What "dependencies"?

Ok, but why change this?  What's the advantage?  Are you going to now go
and change all locations of the above in the tree to the table-
versions?  If not, why is this needed?

How am I supposed to be "certain"?

Why is this differnent from CONFIG_TEST build option we have today (or
whatever it's called...)

Anyway, again, I have no idea what this is, nor how I should use it.
And if I am the audience for this type of config option, well, perhaps
it needs to be rethought...
