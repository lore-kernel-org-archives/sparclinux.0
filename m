munlock(all) already lost both MLOCK_LOCKED and MLOCK_ONFAULT flags in 
this revision, so I suppose in the next revision it will also not accept 
MLOCK_ONFAULT, and will just munlock whatever was mlocked in either mode.

The effect of munlockall(MCL_FUTURE|MLOCK_ONFAULT), which you probably 
intended for converting the onfault to full prepopulation for future 
mappings, can be achieved by calling mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) (without 
MLOCK_ONFAULT).
