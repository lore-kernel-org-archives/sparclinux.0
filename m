The kernel is duplicating userspace headers in the UAPI implementation
and running into exactly the same problems we have already solved in
userspace. We currently have no better solution than the "__need_*"
interface for avoiding the duplication of the type definitions and the
problems that come with that.

I am taking this up with senior glibc developers on libc-alpha to see
if we have a better suggestion. If you give me 72 hours I'll either
have a better suggestion or the acknowledgement that my suggestion is
the best practical solution we have.

Note that in a GNU userspace stddef.h here comes from gcc, which
completes the implementation of the C development environment that
provides the types you need. The use of "__need_size_t" is a collusion
between the components of the implementation and use by the Linux
kernel would mean expecting something specific to a GNU
implementation.

I might suggest you use include/uapi/linux/libc-compat.h in an attempt
to abstract away the GNU-specific magic for getting just size_t from
stddef.h. That way you have documented the places that other runtime
authors need to fill out for things to work.

Cheers,
Carlos.
