Hmm, IIUC, all architectures with static folding will simply return
the passed-in p4d pointer for pud_offset(p4d, addr), for 3-level
pagetables. There is no difference for s390. For gup_fast, that p4d
pointer is not really a pointer to a value in a pagetable, but
to some local copy of such a value, and not just for s390.

So, pud = p4d = pointer to copy, and increasing that pud pointer
cannot be the same as pud_offset(p4d, next). I do see your point
however, at last I think :-) My problem is that I do not see where
we would have an s390-specific issue here. Maybe my understanding
of how it works for others with static folding is wrong. That
would explain my difficulties in getting your point...

Exactly, only that nobody seems to follow it, IIUC. Fixing it up
with pXd_addr_end was my impression of what we need to do, in order to
have it work the same way as for others.

Well, from my understanding it feels more unexpected that something
that is supposed to be a pointer to an entry in a page table, really is
just a pointer to some copy somewhere.
