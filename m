Here is something I'd like you guys to test.

Yesterday, Christopher (CC:'d), posted some fixes yesterday and one of
them is very interesting.

Basically the update_mmu_cache() methods on sparc64 can insert an
invalid PTE into the TSB hash tables, causing livelocks and other
annoying issues.

The path where this can happen is via remove_migration_pte().

I had a discussion with Johannes Weiner about this and we determined
that it would make sense to mis-diagnose THP as being the root cause
in the RSS counter et al. problems if this bug here is the real
reason those things are happening.

That's because if you're not using THP there is less compaction going
on.  Less compaction means less migration, and therefore a lower
likelyhood of this code path triggering like this.

Could you guys please try this patch below?  Thanks.
