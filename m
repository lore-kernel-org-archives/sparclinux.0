Removing the code from the block layer needs to be ACKed by block 
maintainers --- and it can be done if it will be found that on 
architectures that use it (alpha, pa-risc) it has no benefit. I believe 
that it will eventually show up that there is little/no benefit from the 
hw_segments accounting, but it will take some time.

This patch is a simple fix that can be done now to stop sparc64 from 
crashing. (most other architectures also define it as 0 --- for the same 
reason, they can't guarantee that the merge will happen).

So if it stays and if you find time to fix it, you can revert it back to 
8192.

But until one of two possible solutions happen (removing the virtual merge 
accounting or declaring that it must stay and fixing sparc64), the 
simplest way to avoid crashes is to define BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY 0.
