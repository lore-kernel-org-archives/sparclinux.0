What I am contemplating doing is promote
phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size to be global variables (similar to
initrd_start, initrd_end) and have a generic helper function for parsing
the initrd= command line parameter and finally removing
__early_init_dt_declare_initrd() because we could have
early_init_dt_check_for_initrd() just populate
phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size directly as well as
initrd_start/initrd_end using __va() to preserve compatibility with
architectures that rely on this. Then I would convert ARM64 to check for
phys_initrd_start which is really what it is is trying to do in
arch/arm64/mm/init.c::arm64_memblock_init().

Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
