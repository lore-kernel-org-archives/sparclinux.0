Interesting. I have some I2C devices that run into the problem where
their interrupts cannot be resolved at instantiation time so I've had to
work around it by calling irq_of_parse_and_map() at .probe() time and
return -EPROBE_DEFER if that return NO_IRQ.

Are any of your plans documented somewhere? I'd be interested to know
how this is supposed to be solved. irq_of_parse_and_map() is not going
to work for non-DT setups so the above can't be a proper solution.
