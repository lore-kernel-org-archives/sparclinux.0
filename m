Why do BPF filters use the module space, and does this reason apply to
all architectures?

On arm64, we already support loading plain modules far away from the
core kernel (i.e. out of range for ordinary relative jump/calll
instructions), and so I'd expect BPF to be able to deal with this
already as well. So for arm64, I wonder why an ordinary vmalloc_exec()
wouldn't be more appropriate.

So before refactoring the module alloc/free routines to accommodate
BPF, I'd like to take one step back and assess whether it wouldn't be
more appropriate to have a separate bpf_alloc/free API, which could be
totally separate from module alloc/free if the arch permits it.
