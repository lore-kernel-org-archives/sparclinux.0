Is this write-combining from the point of view of the device (ie iommu),
or from the point of view of the CPU, or both?

Surely we only need a helper which drivrs can call from their mmap routine to solve this?

I really think this wants to be a separate function.  dma_alloc_coherent
is for allocating memory to be shared between the kernel and a driver;
we already have dma_map_sg for mapping userspace I/O as an alternative
interface.  This feels like it's something different again rather than
an option to dma_alloc_coherent.
