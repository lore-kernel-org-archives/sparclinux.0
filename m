I'm failing to see why it's a problem to have the hook (which could
just as easily be a generic proc_root_init_prepare hook called from
proc_root_init(), allowing usage by various other subsystems), but
okay.  

I'm not that familiar w/ the dynamic tree stuff; do you imagine this
being an invasive change, or will it be as simple as just deferring the
init call?
