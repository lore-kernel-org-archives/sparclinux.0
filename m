Sowmini,

the patch/commit is actually quite trivial, it just adds device_id
matches for newer T5/M7 CPUs to n2rng_match structure. Without this
patch, n2rng does not work on this newer CPUs. Works well on my T5-2
LDOM (tested with rng-tools and gpg --gen-key). I don't have M7
machine to test it with.

Why the n2rng selftest fails on your machine - I've no idea... Just to
silence it, you can blacklist this module, since it does not work your
hardware anyway.

Can you please send me "prtconf -pv" output from your machine, as well
information on how do you run linux as LDOM container or baremetal
T5-2 ?

Mine T5-2 is one of the last firmware releases (run from solaris 11.3
control domain):

root@deimos:/home/sysadmin# prtdiag -v
============== FW Version ==============
Sun System Firmware 9.5.3 2015/11/25 09:50

sysadmin@deimos:~$ ldm -V

Can you please check what firmware release if yours T5-2 server and
probably update? I'm not sure it would help, but anyway.
