The way I usually deal with this is to make two branches. One with the
changes the other depends on and then merge this branch into the other
and put the changes on top. Then you can provide a complete branch that
people can test when you send the patchset out by just linking to it in
the cover letter.
(But if it's too much hazzle just leave it.)

If people think splitting it out makes sense and we can settle the
technical details I can take it and let it stew in linux-next at least
for a little while.
I have changes to clone3() in there that touch
copy_clone_args_from_user() anyway and there are tests for clone3()
struct copying so we'd catch regressions (for clone3() at least) pretty
quickly.
If we don't see any major issues in the next two weeks it might even be
ok to send for 5.4.
