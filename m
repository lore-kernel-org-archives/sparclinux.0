Apart from performance impact when re-doing that what has already been
done by the caller, I think we would also break the READ_ONCE semantics.
After all, the pXd_offset() would also require some pXd pointer input,
which we don't have. So we would need to start over again from mm->pgd.

Also, it seems to be more in line with other primitives that take
a pXd value or pointer.
