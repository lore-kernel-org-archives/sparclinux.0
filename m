Honestly I think that num_posible_cpus() should return the max of number 
of CPUs (weigt), and the highest numbered CPU. It's a pain in the butt 
to handle this otherwise.

/* If cpus are offline, map them to first hctx */
map = kzalloc_node(sizeof(*map) * num_possible_cpus(), GFP_KERNEL,
                                 set->numa_node);

is where it goes wrong, assuming Meelis has NR_CPUS set to something < 
14, which was the highest numbered CPU, iirc. A construct like:

map = alloc(num_possible_cpus());
for_each_possible_cpu(i)
     map[i] = ...

seems like the obvious way to do things, yet it's broken. And not broken 
on x86 where we'd find the issue pretty quickly, but on sparc64 where 
it'll take a lot longer to run into. It just violates the principle of 
least surprise, which is bad for an API.

That said, if there was a helper like Christoph suggested, it'd be a bit 
better. And perhaps we can't just modify num_possible_cpus(), we'd need 
num_*_cpus() for the other bitmaps, too. That might be breaking other 
things...

Meelis, can you try the attached?
