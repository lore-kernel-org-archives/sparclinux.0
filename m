Subject: [PATCH] sparc: clarify __GFP_NOFAIL allocation

920c3ed74134 ([SPARC64]: Add basic infrastructure for MD add/remove
notification.) has added __GFP_NOFAIL for the allocation request but
it hasn't mentioned why is this strict requirement really needed.
The code was handling an allocation failure and propagated it properly
up the callchain so it is not clear why it is needed.

Dave has clarified the intention when I tried to remove the flag as not
being necessary:
"
It is a serious failure.

If we miss an MDESC update due to this allocation failure, the update
is not an event which gets retransmitted so we will lose the updated
machine description forever.

We really need this allocation to succeed.
"

So add a comment to clarify the nofail flag and get rid of the failure
check because __GFP_NOFAIL allocation doesn't fail.
