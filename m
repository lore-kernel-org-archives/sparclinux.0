I've successfully tested this with musl and LTP now, using an
i386 kernel. The musl port I used is at
https://git.linaro.org/people/arnd.bergmann/musl-y2038.git/
This is just an updated version of what I used for testing last
year, using the current syscall assignment, and going back
to the time32 versions of getitimer/setitimer and
wait4/waitid/getusage.

It's certainly not intended for merging like this, but a proper
musl port is under discussion now, and this should be
sufficient if anyone else wants to try out the new syscall
ABI before we merge it.

The LTP I have is heavily hacked, and has a number of
failures resulting from differences between musl and glibc,
or from the way we convert between the kernel types and
the user space types.

The testing found one minor bug in all the kernel syscall tables:

> +419    common  mq_timedreceiv_time64           sys_mq_timedreceive

While this would have fit in with umount(), creat() and mknod(),
it was unintentional, and I've changed it back to
mq_timedreceive_time64 (with an added 'e').
