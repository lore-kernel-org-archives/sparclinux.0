I haven't gotten many responses so I'm going to try sending again
(this time with a cover letter which I probably should have done in
the first place...)

ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN is currently defined as needed in asm/scatterlist.h.
It was suggested[1] that this should probably be a proper Kconfig.
At the same time, we can clean up most of the asm/scatterlist.h files
to reduce redundancy. This makes parisc the only architecture that still
has an asm/scatterlist.h file due to the #define sg_virt_addr (which
could probably be cleaned up further still)

Andrew, once we get a few more Acked-bys can we take this through your tree
as suggested by Will?

Thanks,
Laura
