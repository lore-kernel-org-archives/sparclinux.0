No.  I really can't.  I think we are stuck with 32bit alignment on 32bit
architectures at this point.  Which precludes 32bit architectures from
including a 64bit field.

The variant of this that concerns me the most is siginfo_t embedded in a
structure in a library combined with code that is compiled with new
headers.  The offset of the embedded siginfo_t could very easily change
and break things.

That makes the alignment an ABI property we can't mess with.  Shame.

I will figure out some static asserts to verify this property remains
on 32bit and respin this series.
