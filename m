Sorry, I do not understand - what is 32-bit on V440? The kernel should 
be 64-bit since it's sun4u.

It might be related to my problem, yes (I have different kernel configs 
on different machines and the XFRM settings are varying at least). 

However, I have not succeeded in reproducing the problem at will - git 
checkout of another release + subsequent compile still does not trigger 
it. But if it is the same problem, it seems to go int triple fault or 
something similar for me to cause it reboot with no trace in the 
console.
