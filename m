I'll bite, since this was sent to linux-api:

Can someone explain what this feature does for the benefit of people
who haven't read the manual (and who don't even know where to find the
manual)?

Are the top few bits of a sparc64 virtual address currently
must-be-zero?  Does this feature change the semantics so that those
bits are ignored for address resolution and instead must match
whatever the ADI tag is determined to be during address resolution?

Is this enforced for both user and kernel accesses?

Is the actual ADI tag associated with a "page" associated with the
page of physical memory or is it associated with a mapping?  That is,
if there are two virtual aliases of the same physical page (in the
same process or otherwise), does the hardware require them to have the
same ADI tag?  If the answer is no, then IMO this is definitely
something that should use mprotect and you should seriously consider
using something like mprotect_key (new syscall, not in Linus' tree
yet) for it.  In fact, you might consider a possible extra parameter
to that syscall for this purpose.

Cc: Dave Hansen.  It seems to be the zeitgeist to throw tag bits at
PTEs these days.
