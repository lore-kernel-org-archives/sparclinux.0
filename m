I'm carrying this from the original code because we want to know asap if 
we have a low level protocol issue.  It should never happen in the 
field, but we want to notice it as soon as we can when doing development 
and testing.  In this patch I've simply made it more obvious and up 
front that we're doing this test rather than having it buried in the 
logic a few lines further down.
