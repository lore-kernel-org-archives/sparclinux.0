Note that the semantic of MAP_LOCKED can be subtly surprising:

"mlock(2) fails if the memory range cannot get populated to guarantee
that no future major faults will happen on the range. mmap(MAP_LOCKED) 
on the other hand silently succeeds even if the range was populated only
partially."

( from http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m3152790412727&w=2 )

So MAP_LOCKED can silently behave like MAP_LOCKONFAULT. While 
MAP_LOCKONFAULT doesn't suffer from such problem, I wonder if that's 
sufficient reason not to extend mmap by new mlock() flags that can be 
instead applied to the VMA after mmapping, using the proposed mlock2() 
with flags. So I think instead we could deprecate MAP_LOCKED more 
prominently. I doubt the overhead of calling the extra syscall matters here?

If the new LOCKONFAULT functionality is indeed desired (I haven't still 
decided myself) then I agree that would be the cleanest way.
