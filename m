It's a bit more complicated, but...

Absolutely.  Those piles of ifdefs are unreadable garbage.

I'd done some digging in that area, will find the notes and post.
Basically, we can even avoid the odd/even annotations and have
COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE... sort it out.  It's a bit more hairy than
I would like at this stage in the cycle, though.  I'll see if it can
be done without too much PITA.

However, there still are genuinely speci^Wfucked in head cases - see
e.g. this sad story:

    parisc: fix fanotify_mark() syscall on 32bit compat kernel

Those certainly ought to stay in arch/*
