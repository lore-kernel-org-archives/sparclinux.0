Well, I'm trying to understand what that would buy us.

If I'm always going to see that kind of sequence:

	rX = r10
	rx += offset

then I always have that "r10" move available to deal with the bias.
It comes for free.

Right now the current version of the sparc64 JIT will emit:

	add	%fp, 2047, bpf2sparc[rX]
	add	bpf2sparc[rX], offset, bpf2sparc[rX]

for that BPF sequence.

Anyways, thanks to your and Daniel's feedback I'm very confident
with the code now.  All that's really left is tail calls, and I'll
set up a BPF compilation and test environment for that.
