The changelog should state that this only changes the source code, there 
is no functional change since alloc_buffer_head() and 
kmem_cache_zalloc(transaction_cache) are already implicitly nofail due to 
the allocation order.  The failure code added by the commit you cite are 
never executed.

I agree that if the implementation of the page allocator were to change 
with respect to PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER that we'd need __GFP_NOFAIL and 
that such an allocation is better handled in the page allocator.

GFP_NOFS|__GFP_NOFAIL is scary.
