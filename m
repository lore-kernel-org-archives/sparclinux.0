I am probably missing something important, but why are we 
saving/restoring the content of pages that were explicitly removed from 
the identity mapping such that nobody will access them?

Pages that are not allocated should contain garbage or be zero 
(init_on_free). That should be easy to handle without ever reading the 
page content.

The other user seems to be vm_remove_mappings(), where we only 
*temporarily* remove the mapping - while hibernating, that code 
shouldn't be active anymore I guess - or we could protect it from happening.

As I expressed in another mail, secretmem pages should rather not be 
saved when hibernating - hibernation should be rather be disabled.

What am I missing?
