Agree, will make the change.

Thanks for catching this.
As per my understanding, I think, all DMA map/unmap go through
ATU (iommu) in sun4v sparc. To guarantee that driver doesn't get DMA
address beyond its addressable range , driver must set dma mask before
requesting any DMA mapping!

I will investigate further and send v2.

Thanks for the review.
