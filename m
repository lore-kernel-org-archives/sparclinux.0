This was attempted in the past with the result that you might guess.

Well, apparently new bootloaders are being corrupted by the u-Boot image 
format themselves.

And in the end I don't mind that much, as long as this is once again 
made architecture independent and therefore implemented in an 
architecture independent way in the kernel build system.

Why don't you try yourself?  I bet you already did in the past.

Look Jean-Christophe, we do have a kernel maintenance problem here.  
The goal of this patch series is to solve that maintenance problem while 
preserving the same level of support as before, not to change the world.
