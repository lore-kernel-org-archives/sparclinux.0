I think we have two issues if we reuse those numbers for new syscalls.
First, I'd really like to see new syscalls be numbered consistently
everywhere, or at least on all x86 variants, and we can't on x32
because they mean something else.  Perhaps more importantly, due to
what is arguably a rather severe bug, issuing a native x86_64 syscall
(x32 bit clear) with nr in the range 512..547 does *not* return
-ENOSYS on a kernel with x32 enabled.  Instead it does something that
is somewhat arbitrary.  With my patch applied, it will return -ENOSYS,
but old kernels will still exist, and this will break syscall probing.

Can we perhaps just start the consistent numbers above 547 or maybe
block out 512..547 in the new regime?
