My Ultra 5 (same mainboard as the Ultra 10) boots 2.6.26-rc9
just fine. So Alexander's problem is probably caused by .config
settings or his toolchain.

My working 2.6.26-rc9 .config and a boot log are available in
<http://user.it.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/ultra5/> in case someone wants
to use them as a starting point for debugging this problem.

The toolchain I used has gcc-4.3.1 and binutils-2.17.50.0.3.
