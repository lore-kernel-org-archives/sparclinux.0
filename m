Seems that there are some confusion.

It's not likely that the DMA boundary restriction causes this issue
because we set it to 4G by default.

As Mikulas pointed out, before my IOMMU work, this problem existed in
SPARC64 (and other architectures that set BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY to non
zero) because IOMMUs can't guarantee that they merge sg segments.

I think that now we hit this problems due to the max_segment_size.

In the past, IOMMUs aggressively merged sg entries. IOMMUs ignored the
block layer's max_segment_size (64K by default), merge sg segments,
and create a large segment. But most of LLDs can handle a segment size
larger than 64K. So everything was fine.

Now IOMMUs don't ignore the max_segment_size. We hit this problem.

It's the right thing that IOMMUs don't ignore the max_segment_size. I
guess that if the A100u2w driver sets a max_segment_size to a larger
value, the problem will be fixed. However, as we discussed, IOMMUs
can't guarantee that they merge sg segments. It's possible that we
still hit this problem.

We tell SCSI driver developers that the drivers don't get the larger
number of segments than they tell the SCSI subsystem. If we keep the
virtual merge concept, we need to fix this first.


Sorry about this problem. As I said, this problem existed before my
IOMMU work, but I should have taken care about this.
