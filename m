Weird.  Yeah, no other platforms expect to get a phandle type
definition from the kernel headers.  The only thing driving this
conversation is from arch/sparc/include/asm/Kbuild:

header-y += openprom.h

I don't have any background on the history of that file or why it
needs to be exported to userspace.  There seems to be a lot of stuff
in there; but I cannot see the *_funcs structures having any utility
outside of the kernel.  Perhaps they should be moved out of
asm/openprom.h?

Here are the two affected structures:

$ git grep linux_nodeops arch/sparc/include
arch/sparc/include/asm/openprom.h:      struct linux_nodeops *pv_nodeops;
arch/sparc/include/asm/openprom.h:struct linux_nodeops {
arch/sparc/include/asm/oplib_32.h:extern struct linux_nodeops *prom_nodeops;
$ git grep linux_dev_v2_funcs arch/sparc/include
arch/sparc/include/asm/openprom.h:struct linux_dev_v2_funcs {
arch/sparc/include/asm/openprom.h:      struct linux_dev_v2_funcs pv_v2devops;
(devicetree/next) ~/hacking/linux-2.6$ 

And linux_romvec references linux_nodeops:
$ git grep linux_romvec arch/sparc/include
arch/sparc/include/asm/openprom.h:struct linux_romvec {
arch/sparc/include/asm/oplib_32.h:extern struct linux_romvec *romvec;
arch/sparc/include/asm/oplib_32.h:extern void prom_init(struct linux_romvec *rom_ptr);

oplib_32.h is not exported.

g.
