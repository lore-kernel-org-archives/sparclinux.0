After merging the owner value directly into the count field, it was
found that the number of failed optimistic spinning operations increased
significantly during the boot up process.

The cause of this increased failures was tracked down to the condition
that a lock holder might have just released the lock and gone to sleep
right after its owner value was fetched by a spinner. So the task might
have slept, but it was no longer the lock holder. The merging of owner
into count increases the chance this condition can happen.

To close this failure mode, we are now rechecking the owner value again
to see if it has been changed in case it is not on cpu.

On a 1-socket x86-64 system, the lock event counts before the patch
were:

  rwsem_opt_failX47
  rwsem_opt_wlockx80
  rwsem_wlockX47

After the patch, the counts were:

  rwsem_opt_fail"5
  rwsem_opt_wlock=8541
  rwsem_wlock"5
