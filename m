I've took all the patches to the next-dma-debug branch in my tree, I sorry
that You have to wait so long for it. My branch is based on Joerg's
dma-debug branch and I've included it for testing in linux-next branch.

Joerg: would You mind if I handle pushing the whole branch to v3.8
via my kernel tree? Those changes should be kept close together to
avoid build breaks for bisecting.

Best regards
