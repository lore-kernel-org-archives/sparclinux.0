Again, this is to help the linker keep arrays in tacked. Tracepoints are
allocated into the tracepoint section, and then read like an array. If
the linker adds holes as it links sections into one big one, then the
reading of the array breaks.

We either need to compact it (with the align(4)) which is undesirable,
or add our own holes like the above does.
