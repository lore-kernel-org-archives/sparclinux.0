And here's the test module.

To illustrate the bug it uses math-emu to convert a series of
single-bit power-of-two ints to corresponding floats and back,
and prints the intermediate representations and the differences
between the original values and the final ones.  These ints all
have exact float representations so there should be no differences.

But for 0x08000000 the conversion goes wrong.  The test case
then converts a few more numbers near this one and up to the next
power-of-two which did convert Ok.

With an unpatched kernel you get the following kernel messages
after insmod:

With the patch applied, you instead get this:

Unfortunately it seems difficult to write a generic module
which uses math-emu:
- <math-emu/soft-fp.h> includes <asm/sfp-machine.h>,
  but only a handful of archs have it
- <asm/sfp-machine.h> isn't always self-contained and may depend
  on various $arch-specific declarations being present

The given test module works on sparc64 and ppc64, where it uses
the kernel's sfp-machine.h, and on x86 where it uses a stub
sfp-machine.h supplied by itself.  I tried to cross-compile it
for alpha, but that failed due to its sfp-machine.h not being
self-contained.  I didn't try sh or s390.
