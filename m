You're absolutely right -- good catch!

This indeed does appear to be the simplest solution -- I'm currently
testing a variation of the patch you proposed (with a few extra bits to
deal with nd_jump_link and proc_get_link being used elsewhere).

I'll include this change (assuming it fixes the flaw you found) in the
v13 series I'll send around next week. Thanks, Jann!
