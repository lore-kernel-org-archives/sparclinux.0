Yes I hate adding new (arch) config options as well. And I still believe
we do not need any here either...

I wouldn't be so sure about this. If any other platform has a similar
issues with small memset as sparc then the overhead is just papered over
by parallel initialization.

Maybe and I would highly appreciate that.
