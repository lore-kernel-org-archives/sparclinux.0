I think I already responded to Helge before and yes, I think that parisc
doesn't do anything special for fork, vfork, clone, and by extension
also probably doesn't need to for clone3.
It should only be a problem for arches that require mucking explicitly
with arguments of clone-like syscalls.
In any case, I saw Helge's patch and I think I might've missed to add an
Acked-by but feel free to add it.

Thanks for testing it and sorry that I couldn't test!
Christian
