Your observation is correct.

Another way to describe the problem is existing pXd_addr_end helpers
could be applied to mismatching levels on s390 (e.g p4d_addr_end
applied to pud or pgd_addr_end applied to p4d). As you noticed,
all *_pXd_range iterators could be called with address ranges that
exceed single pXd table.

However, when it happens with pointers to real page tables (passed to
*_pXd_range iterators) we still operate on valid tables, which just
(lucky for us) happened to be folded. Thus we still reference correct
table entries.

It is only gup_fast case that exposes the issue. It hits because
pointers to stack copies are passed to gup_pXd_range iterators, not
pointers to real page tables itself.

As Gerald mentioned, it is very difficult to explain in a clear way.
Hopefully, one could make sense ot of it.
