Ok, but this as a cause looks weird.
The function tracer handler disables interrupts. I don't remember exactly
why but we also have a no-preempt mode that only disables preemption instead:
(function_trace_call_preempt_only())

It means having such interrupt reentrancy is not a problem. In fact, the
function tracer is not reentrant:

	data = tr->data[cpu];
	disabled = atomic_inc_return(&data->disabled);

	if (likely(disabled = 1))
		trace_function(tr, ip, parent_ip, flags, pc);

	atomic_dec(&data->disabled);

we do this just to prevent from tracing recursion (in case we have
a traceable function in the inner function tracing path).

Nmis are just supposed to be fine with the function tracer.
