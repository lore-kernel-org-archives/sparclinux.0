This series was originally part of the series ("serial: Finish kgdb on
qcom_geni; fix many lockdep splats w/ kgdb") but it made sense to
split it up.

It's believed that dropping into kgdb should be more robust once these
patches are applied.

Changes in v6:
- Moved smp_call_function_single_async() error check to patch 3.

Changes in v5:
- Add a comment about get_irq_regs().
- get_cpu() => raw_smp_processor_id() in kgdb_roundup_cpus().
- for_each_cpu() => for_each_online_cpu()
- Error check smp_call_function_single_async()

Changes in v4:
- Removed smp_mb() calls.
- Also clear out .debuggerinfo.
- Also clear out .debuggerinfo and .task for the master.
- Remove clearing out in kdb_stub for offline CPUs; it's now redundant.

Changes in v3:
- No separate init call.
- Don't round up the CPU that is doing the rounding up.
- Add "#ifdef CONFIG_SMP" to match the rest of the file.
- Updated desc saying we don't solve the "failed to roundup" case.
- Document the ignored parameter.
- Don't round up a CPU that failed rounding up before new for v3.
- Don't back trace on a cpu that didn't round up new for v3.

Changes in v2:
- Removing irq flags separated from fixing lockdep splat.
- Don't use smp_call_function (Daniel).

Douglas Anderson (4):
  kgdb: Remove irq flags from roundup
  kgdb: Fix kgdb_roundup_cpus() for arches who used smp_call_function()
  kgdb: Don't round up a CPU that failed rounding up before
  kdb: Don't back trace on a cpu that didn't round up
