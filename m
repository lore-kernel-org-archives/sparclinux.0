I looked at the assembly code in arch/x86/include/asm/rwsem.h. For both
trylocks (read & write), the count is read first before attempting to
lock it. We did the same for all trylock functions in other locks.
Depending on how the trylock is used and how contended the lock is, it
may help or hurt performance. Changing down_read_trylock to do an
unconditional cmpxchg will change the performance profile of existing
code. So I would prefer keeping the current code.

I do notice now that the generic down_write_trylock() code is doing an
unconditional compxchg. So I wonder if we should change it to read the
lock first like other trylocks or just leave it as it is.

Cheers,
Longman
