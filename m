The two patch sets combined would hopefully do better then that,
although I don't know what the clock speed is on the CPUs in use.

The system I have been testing with has 1.5TB spread over 4 nodes. So
we have effectively 3 times as much to initialize and with the
"numa=FAke=3D8U" I was seeing it only take .275s to initialize the
nodes.

The point I was trying to make is that it doesn't. You say it is an
order of magnitude better but it is essentially 3.5x vs 3.8x and to
achieve the 3.8x you are using a ton of system resources. My approach
is meant to do more with less, while this approach will throw a
quarter of the system at  page initialization.

An added advantage to my approach is that it speeds up things
regardless of the number of cores used, whereas the scaling approach
requires that there be more cores available to use. So for example on
some of the new AMD Zen stuff I am not sure the benefit would be all
that great since if I am not mistaken each tile is only 8 processors
so at most you are only doubling the processing power applied to the
initialization. In such a case it is likely that my approach would
fare much better then this approach since I don't require additional
cores to achieve the same results.

Anyway there are tradeoffs we have to take into account.

I will go over the changes you suggested after Plumbers. I just need
to figure out if I am doing incremental changes, or if Andrew wants me
to just resubmit the whole set. I can probably deal with these changes
either way since most of them are pretty small.

Thanks.
