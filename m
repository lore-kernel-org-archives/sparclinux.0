I should have split that into two commits back then. When writing the
vmemmap code for s390 I realized that we never guaranteed that zones
start on a MAX_ORDER boundary or have a size that is a multiple of
MAX_ORDER. So I just added HOLES_IN_ZONE.

This just made sure that all zones start on a MAX_ORDER boundary and
just leaves memory that doesn't fit unused. So the requirement for
HOLES_IN_ZONE went away.

Later I reduced MAX_ORDER to 9 on s390, so we don't leave large
portions of memory unused.
