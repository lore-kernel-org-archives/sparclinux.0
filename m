We have two types, tables and ranges. But I'll drop that.

Sure, thanks changed.

I've dropped the type thing.

Right, OK dropped and only kept type for this.

It can be used in asm code to do actually what DEFINE_LINKTABLE() does but now
that I think about it this should then match the name and we'd need one per
standard section, as we have for linker table in C code. I've demo'd this
use in the userspace mockup git tree but with section ranges. In the meantime
I've dropped these macros from this series for now. When we need them we can add
them.

Sure. Will shoot for that.

Not for us, it just one added benefit that's possible from it.

OK will be sure to clarify all this and thanks for the typo fixes, etc.

This should be decided per subsystem maintainer.

I suppose we could make this configurable... But frankly I would prefer to
instead just document that this use should be carefully considered instead,
and let this be up to the maintainers. We can make it easily configurable so
we can do that later becomes a required, I don't think its needed though
given maintainers should use it only when needed.

Will fix ordering.

I've nuked SECTION_TYPE_TABLES and SECTION_TYPE_RANGES

The ones we didn't have uses for yet I've nuked now.
