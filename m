As I understand, the point is that on PAT-enabled systems, the
normal ioremap() *also* overrides the MTRR, citing from
Documentation/x86/pat.rst:

Ok, fair enough. Let's just go with your version for now, if only to not
hold your series up more. I'd still suggest we change atyfb to only
use ioremap_uc() on i386 and maybe ia64. I can send a patch for that.
