FWIW, I am extracting the ARM implementation that parses the initrd
early command line parameter and the "setup" code doing the page
boundary alignment and memblock checking into a helper into lib/ that
other architectures can re-use. So far, this removes the need for
unicore32, arc and arm to duplicate essentially the same logic.
