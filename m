I don't think that crc32c() is thread safe because of the way it is
implemented with a shared TFM crypto object allocated once at boot
time.

I think you are seeing the corruption any time an interrupt comes in
on the same cpu as your test module is running on and does a crc32c()
calculation, corrupting the context key value being used by your
invocation.

At least that's my guess, I could have misread how the key is stored
and managed around operations.

Can you try something like disabling cpu IRQs around the crc32c() function
in lib/libcrc32c.c?  Something like:

	u32 retval;

	local_irq_disable();

	shash->tfm = tfm;
	shash->flags = 0;
	*ctx = crc;

	err = crypto_shash_update(shash, address, length);
	BUG_ON(err);

	retval = *ctx;

	local_irq_enable();

	return retval;

Thanks.
