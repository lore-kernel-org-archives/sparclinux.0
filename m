OK, so I did git reset --hard bed475c4cde5d12f537f445bdd0a5a3bb5684481
to get back to the point which the bisection said was the problem, and
yet that version of 2.6.27-rc2 also exhibited the firmware problem.

Then I went back up to git reset --hard bf6583b5831d3195c45f98ec3016499389cbe18f
to see if it'll do that again, and that 2.6.26 *also* did the same.

So I reviewed my steps and concluded that the only other thing different was
adding ql2xextended_error_logging=1. I undid that change, rebuilt the
initramfs image, and then the machine booted fine!

So, um, please fix the debugging code so that it doesn't cause more bugs... :/

In the meantime, I'll go back up to bed475c4cde5d12f537f445bdd0a5a3bb5684481
and see how it does with the debugging patch.
