OK, fair enough. As I've mentioned in the cover letter I do not really
insist on this patch. I just found the current code too ugly to
live without a good reason because down_write is a call so saving one
push/pop seems like really negligible to the call itself. Moreover this
is a write lock which is expected to be heavier. It is the read path
which is expected to be light and contention (slow path) is expected
on the write lock.

That being said, if you really believe that the current code is easier
to maintain then I will not pursue this patch. The rest doesn't really
depend on it. I will just respin the follow up x86 specifi
__down_write_killable to follow the same code convention.

One way would be to do the same thing as mutex does and do the fast path
as an inline. This could bloat the kernel and require some additional
changes to allow arch specific reimplementations though so I didn't want
to go that path.
