I agree with the philosophy, but I think it doesn’t apply in this case.  Here are the flags:

O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR: not even a proper bitmask. The kernel already has the FMODE_ bits to make this make sense. How about we make the openat2 permission bits consistent with the internal representation and let the O_ permission bits remain as an awful translation.  The kernel already translates like this, and it already sucks.

O_CREAT, O_TMPFILE, O_NOCTTY, O_TRUNC: not modes on the fd at all.  These affect the meaning of open().  Heck, for openat2, NOCTTY should be this default.

O_EXCL: hopelessly overloaded.

O_APPEND, O_DIRECT, O_SYNC, O_DSYNC, O_LARGEFILE, O_NOATIME, O_PATH, O_NONBLOCK: genuine mode bits

O_CLOEXEC: special because it affects the fd, not the struct file.

Linus, you rejected resolveat() because you wanted a *nice* API that people would use and that might even be adopted by other OSes. Let’s please not make openat2() be a giant pile of crap in the name of consistency with open().  open(), frankly, is horrible.
