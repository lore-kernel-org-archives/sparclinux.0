Yes in this instance I was/am. Thanks for the explanation.

However the same R_SPARC_13 also exists in scsi_mod.ko. It exists in the
original Debian 2.6.37-trunk-sparc64 version and in my current build of
the same with the 8 byte alignment for _trace_events.

I guess that points towards the binutils linker not doing the correct
thing.

ld reports its version as

$ ld -v
GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.20.1-system.20100303

and scsi_mod.ko is linked with the following command

ld -r -m elf64_sparc -T /richmtmp/linux-2.6-2.6.37/scripts/module-common.lds --build-id  -o drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.o drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.mod.o
