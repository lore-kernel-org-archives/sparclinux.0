The Baoquan's patch almost did it, at least for simple case of qemu with 2
nodes. It's only missing the adjustment to the size passed to
memmap_init_zone() as it may change because of clamping.

I've drafted something that removes HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP and added this
patch there [1]. For several memory configurations I could emulate with
qemu it worked.
I'm going to wait a bit to see of kbuild is happy and then I'll send the
patches.

Baoquan, I took liberty to add your SoB, hope you don't mind.
