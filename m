That, IIRC, was about untangling the weirdness around multiple calls of
dirfd_path_init() and basically went "we might want just strip the slashes
in case of that flag very early in the entire thing, so that later the
normal logics for absolute/relative would DTRT".  Since your check is
right next to checking for absolute pathnames (and not in the very
beginning of path_init()), we might as well turn the check for
absolute pathname into *s = '/' && !(flags & LOOKUP_IN_ROOT) and be
done with that.
