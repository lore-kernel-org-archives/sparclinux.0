What is the reason for all the rework on the irq parsing return values?
A return value of '0' is always an error on irq parsing, regardless of
architecture even if NO_IRQ is defined as -1. I may have missed it, but
I don't see any checking for specific error values in the return paths
of the functions.

If the specific return value isn't required (and I don't think it is),
then you can simplify the whole series by getting rid of the rework
patches.
