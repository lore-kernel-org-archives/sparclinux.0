No, I think we should instead move the other trylocks to the 
try-for-ownership model as well, like Linus suggested.

That's the general assumption we make in locking primitives, that we 
optimize for the common, expected case - which would be that the trylock 
succeeds, and I don't see why trylock primitives should be different.

In fact I can see more ways for read-for-sharing to perform suboptimally 
on larger systems.

Thanks,
