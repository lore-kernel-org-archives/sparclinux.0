Hm, I think Ard has a good point. AFAIK, and correct me if I'm wrong,
users of module_alloc() i.e. kprobes, ftrace, bpf, seem to use it
because it is an easy way to obtain executable kernel memory (and
depending on the needs of the architecture, being additionally
reachable via relative branches) during runtime. The side effect is
that all these users share the "module" memory space, even though this
memory region is not exclusively used by modules (well, personally I
think it technically should be, because seeing module_alloc() usage
outside of the module loader is kind of a misuse of the module API and
it's confusing for people who don't know the reason behind its usage
outside of the module loader).

Right now I'm not sure if it makes sense to impose a blanket limit on
all module_alloc() allocations when the real motivation behind the
rlimit is related to BPF, i.e., to stop unprivileged users from
hogging up all the vmalloc space for modules with JITed BPF filters.
So the rlimit has more to do with limiting the memory usage of BPF
filters than it has to do with modules themselves.

I think Ard's suggestion of having a separate bpf_alloc/free API makes
a lot of sense if we want to keep track of bpf-related allocations
(and then the rlimit would be enforced for those). Maybe part of the
module mapping space could be carved out for bpf filters (e.g. have
BPF_VADDR, BPF_VSIZE, etc like how we have it for modules), or
continue sharing the region but explicitly define a separate bpf_alloc
API, depending on an architecture's needs. What do people think?

Thanks,

Jessica
