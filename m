Hmm, okay.  I still hate having the queues in the driver so we should
think about a nice mid-layer helper for this.  E.g. having a return
value from ->queuecommand that means "prepared but not issued the command"
and then an irq-safe API to grab these commands from the irq handler.
This would mean all the list managment and especially the EH related
code could move to the midlayer.

You don't need to anything too special.  You'll need calls to
scsi_set_tag_type and scsi_activate_tcq in ->slave_configure,
scsi_deactivate_tcq in case you need to deactivate tcq support on
a device and make sure to call scsi_populate_tag_msg when starting
a command.  All these have nice kerneldoc descriptions in
include/scsi/scsi_tcq.h.
