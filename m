Actually, the issue is that I wanted the interrupt handler to run with
interrupts disabled.

We had big problems when openning thousands of virtual network
devices, each with their own unique IRQ, and pointed all at the same
cpu, and we'd get IRQ stack overflows.

See commit c58543c869606532c2382f027d6466f4672ea756

So this change to make IRQF_DISABLED a nop has reintroduced this bug.
