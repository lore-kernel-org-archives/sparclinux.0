Probably so.  But it might get done sooner if you do it.  There's the
added benefit that you can test the exact patch that gets applied.  You
can just:

	git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
	<make your changes>
	git commit -a
	<write a changelog>

then send us the output of "git show".
