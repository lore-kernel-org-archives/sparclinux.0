Yes, but I think that would be very bad interpreter design.
stat/getxattr/access/whatever followed by open is always a TOCTOU
race. The correct sequence of actions is always open followed by
fstat/fgetxattr/...

Yes, this is a more serious concern. For example, if a shell processes
$HISTFILE or something before opening the script. I'm starting to
prefer the idea of just refusing to honor the close-on-exec flag for
the fd passed to fexecve but preserving it, and letting the
interpreter close the file itself if it wants to. This could be done
with or without the new auxv entry stuff.
