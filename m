Looks input-related..

Ok, that 0x6b is obviously the kfree() poisoning, ie it looks like a 
use-after-free problem with a pointer being loaded from a structure that 
had been free'd-

And the trace seems to be (ignore the unreliable one):

Where we have a few missing functions due to inlining, ie the real 
sequence seems to be:

class_device_del ->
  kobject_uevent_env ->
    class_uevent ->
      kobject_get_path ->
	get_kobj_path_length ->
	  parent = kobj;
	  do {
	    strlen(parent->k_name /* kobject_name(parent) */);
	    parent = parent->parent;
	  } while (parent);

so either the kobj or one of it's parents had already been freed when it 
was unregistered due to the disconnect.

I'm not seeing any reference counting or other protection for the device 
("input") on "hid->inputs" list. But I don't know the code. Dmitry? Jiri?
