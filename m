Right. There are three options:

1. Use two configs to identify which syscalls need not be supported by
new architectures.
In this case it makes sense to say LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS and
COMPAT_32BIT_TIME both need to be disabled for new architectures. And,
I can reword the config to what you mention below.

2. Make the LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS eliminate non y2038 safe syscalls
mentioned below only.
In this case only the native and compat functions of the below
mentioned syscalls need to be identified by the config. I like this
option as this clearly identifies which syscalls are deprecated and do
not have a 64 bit counterpart. Not all architectures need to support
turning this off.

3. If we don't need either 1 or 2, then we could stick with what we
have today in the series as CONFIG_64BIT_TIME will be deleted and they
only need #ifdef CONFIG_64BIT.

Let me know if anyone prefers something else.
