Hi David,

Thanks for the info.

Having got the ESP driver going by increasing the Bus Timeout, I have a 
route forward to booting linux from disk.

I will look into the msleep etc. functions and see if I can identify any 
issues with them. As you say, if these are not working correctly ...

I have managed to hack a PTISP SunOS 4.x driver to work with my QLGC,isp 
ISP1000 card. Now that I know the hardware is working, I can be confident 
that the disk on the ISP1000 should be visible to Linux.
If there are no identifiable issues with the sleep functions I will get 
back to debugging the QLGC,isp linux driver and let you know if I find 
anything amiss.

Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
