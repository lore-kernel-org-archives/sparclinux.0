munlock() should do vma merging as well.  I *think* we implemented
that.  More tests for you to add ;)

How are you testing the vma merging and splitting, btw?  Parsing
the profcs files?

I think the way to look at this is to pretend that mm/mlock.c doesn't
exist and ask "how should we design these features".

And that would be:

- mmap() takes a `flags' argument: MAP_LOCKED|MAP_LOCKONFAULT.

- mlock() takes a `flags' argument.  Presently that's
  MLOCK_LOCKED|MLOCK_LOCKONFAULT.

- munlock() takes a `flags' arument.  MLOCK_LOCKED|MLOCK_LOCKONFAULT
  to specify which flags are being cleared.

- mlockall() and munlockall() ditto.


IOW, LOCKED and LOCKEDONFAULT are treated identically and independently.

Now, that's how we would have designed all this on day one.  And I
think we can do this now, by adding new mlock2() and munlock2()
syscalls.  And we may as well deprecate the old mlock() and munlock(),
not that this matters much.

*should* we do this?  I'm thinking "yes" - it's all pretty simple
boilerplate and wrappers and such, and it gets the interface correct,
and extensible.

What do others think?
