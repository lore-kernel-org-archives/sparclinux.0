They should all be there automagically.
A few things to try out...
What machine is this being build on?

Your Makefile contains this:

But does /lib/modules/... contain a sparc kernel?

You could try to build your module using: V=1

And reply with the output. This should give a clue about what flags are picked
up from where.

Most of your Makefile looks fine - I guess we need to find the bug
in the build environmnet and not in the Makefile.
