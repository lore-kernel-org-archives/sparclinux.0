Actually that is one of the reasons (possibly the primary reason) that
we have chosen to keep pid numbers dense.

There may be fewer users of unix shells then their used to be, and we
may now have pidfds.  But until people stop using pids in shells it is a
very valid reason to keep them densly packed.

Intereseting.  I had not heard of that.  That seems a strange choice
for systemd rather than a system administrator to make.  Of course any
design decision that requires manual intervention to get large systems
to work is probably a bad one.
