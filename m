I don't think you gain much with that kind of scheme - it won't take
very long before an architecture misses having a syscall added, and
then someone else adds their own.  Been there with ARM - I was keeping
the syscall table in the same order as x86 for new syscalls, but now
that others have been adding syscalls to the table since I converted
ARM to the tabular form, that's now gone out the window.

So, I think it's completely pointless to do what you're suggesting.
We'll just end up with a big hole in the middle of the syscall table
and then revert back to random numbering of syscalls thereafter again.
