Umm, not really. Those mkwrite/young/huge etc. helpers do only exist for
page table levels where we can also have large mappings, at least on s390.
Also, we do (on s390) again check for certain sanity before actually setting
the bits.
Good news is that at least for the pxx_same() checks the memset() is no
problem, because pxx_same() does not do any checks other than the same check.

For the pxx_clear_tests(), maybe it could be an option to put them behind the
pxx_populate_tests(), and rely on them having properly populated (non-clear)
values after that?

Yes, that's where I stopped because it looked rather complicated :-)
Not sure why Kirill suggested it initially, but if using get_unmapped_area()
would only be necessary to get properly initialized page table levels
on s390, you could also defer this to a later add-on patch.
