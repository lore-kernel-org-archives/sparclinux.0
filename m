These are the two most conflicted areas for Sparc.

For addresses, we fully compute the full fully resolved physical
address of all registers of an OF device very early at bootup time
when we first scan the device tree.

Same goes for interrupts, we fully compute them early in the bootup
process.  Also, we support multiple interrupts for a device.
