Perhaps the _real_ fix is just to remove all the interrobanging going on here,
and be in line with all the other die_if_kernel() calls in the file.

Something like this?

(Yeah, I shamelessly snarfed the patch from Jesper, and deleted all the excess
?'s and !'s. I haven't cared enough figure out the proper *-by: attribution
magic to credit Jesper, so someone just add whatever is necessary if they feel
so inclined. I can't pretend to care much about my contribution in this.)
