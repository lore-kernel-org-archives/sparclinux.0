Readers might be blocked e.g. on the memory allocation which cannot
proceed due to OOM. Such a reader might be operating on a remote mm.

Latency is certainly one aspect of it as well because the sooner the
mmap_sem gets released for other readers to sooner the oom_reaper can
tear down the victims address space and release the memory and free up
some memory so that we do not have to wait for the victim to exit.

I am not against interruptible variant as well but I suspect that some
paths are not expected to return EINTR. I haven't checked them for this
but killable is sufficient for the problem I am trying to solve. That
problem is real while latencies do not seem to be that eminent.

down_write_interruptible will be trivial to do on top.
