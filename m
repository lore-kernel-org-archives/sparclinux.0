Sorry, I guess I was a bit too rushy, but I also want to be able to fix all things that come up as I post these before next merge window closes.

It isn't obvious, but needed unfortunately. refcount_inc is done in the way that it won't increment on zero value.
And since for this variable you set the initial refcounter value to zero and then call debug_info_get (that does inc), this
would only WARN and not increment. So for this initial case, we changed it to call refcount_set to "1" to make sure things work
as before.

Best Regards,
Elena.
