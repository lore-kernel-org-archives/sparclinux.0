For fsck sake, folks, if you have bloody /proc, you don't need that shite
at all!  Just do execve on /proc/self/fd/n, and be done with that.

The sole excuse for merging that thing in the first place had been
"would anybody think of children^Wsclerotic^Whardened environments
where they have no /proc at all".

Sheesh...
