Chris,

Thanks for doing this.
So archs can still have their own definition for dma_set_mask() if 
HAVE_ARCH_DMA_SET_MASK is y?
(and similarly for dma_set_coherent_mask() when 
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_DMA_SET_COHERENT_MASK is y)
Any plan to change these?

I'm in a process of making some changes to SPARC iommu so it would be 
good to know. Thanks.
