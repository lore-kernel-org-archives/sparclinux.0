I think for all of these cases the IPv6 header is not 4-byte
aligned in the SKB.  The first case is simply ipv6_hdr->version
which GCC turns into a load of the first 4 byte word of the
headers, then a mask+compare.  And this is fine becasue due
to the "struct in6_addr", gcc may assume that the ipv6 header
struct is at least 4 bytes aligned since in6_addr contains
an array of u32[]'s.

What kind of input path is this packet coming from?  Is it
using some kind of encapsulation?  It's odd for it to not
be 4 byte aligned, you would get the same kind of unaligned
accesses for an ipv4 header if it were misaligned like this.
