James Bottomley suggested imaginary numbers of CPUs some time back,
and I suppose there is no reason you cannot have fractional numbers of
CPUs, and perhaps irrational numbers as well.  Of course, these last two
would require use of floating-point arithmetic (or something similar)
in the kernel.  So I guess we have at several years worth.  Over to you
for the negative numbers.  ;-)
