Agree, but overstated somewhat.

The card in question that the regression is reported against is not a
released card and as such could have a flawed environment, Hardware,
Firmware or other Incompatibility. The fix for the root cause will
likely not touch the driver or the kernel.

It does raise the specter of a possible follow-on patch to address the
root cause under kdump should we determine that the problem can not be
solved in time of release of the Firmware of the current pre-released
card or if we discover that other released cards have a similar Firmware
or Hardware bug. Speculation such as these do not belong on kernel
regression reports IMHO.

Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn
