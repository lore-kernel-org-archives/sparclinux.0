Yes, that's 0.2% code size increase (or none increase, if drop 
inline-__wake_up_bit.patch and apply only the other patches). To me it 
seems crazy, how this code was refactored again and again over time, up to 
8 levels of functions (including passing a pointer to a method). In 2.0.x 
kernel series, it was just a single call to wake up a queue.
