How about following (untested) approach.

We use prom.h to teach the general of layer what SPARC provides.
In prom.h we define the symbol of_address_to_resource which tell
of_address.h that we have a local definition of this function, and
the static version is skipped.

This looks more elegant as we do not have to hardcode SPARC in of_address.h
and this is easy to re-use the sme pattern in other places.

Also pci_address_to_pio already uses the same approach in the same file.
pci_address_to_pio is defined if it was not defined before - I see no
reason to do so which is why I omitted it in the above.
