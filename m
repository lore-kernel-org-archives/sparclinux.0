Finally, bisecting is done. :-)

Well, it took more reboots than a typical Windows XP installation (and thank the heavens for my Sparc64 cross compiler on my Core 2 Duo), but this seems to be the culprit:

    [SPARC64]: Do not ACK an INO if it is disabled or inprogress.
    
    This is also a partial workaround for a bug in the LDOM firmware which
    double-transmits RX inos during high load.  Without this, such an
    event causes the kernel to loop forever in the interrupt call chain
    ACK'ing but never actually running the IRQ handler (and thus clearing
    the interrupt condition in the device).
    
    There is still a bad potential effect when double INOs occur,
    not covered by this changeset.  Namely, if the INO is already on
    the per-cpu INO vector list, we still blindly re-insert it and
    thus we can end up losing interrupts already linked in after
    it.
    
    We could deal with that by traversing the list before insertion,
    but that's too expensive for this edge case.
