While I'm aware that you're simply documenting, it seems unnecessary
to me (and unnecessarily complicating of the cloexec issue) to have
the /dev/fd/N/P form. This could always be resolved by the kernel to a
single temp fd for the new process to use, and in fact it's probably
preferable to always get a "temp fd" in case the fd passed to fexecve
is NOT a throwaway one (e.g. if the original fd was stdin or
something); the program being executed should not have to use ugly and
error-prone heuristics to decide if it should close the exec fd.

On the other hand, this resolution could be done by userspace (open
with O_PATH|O_CLOEXEC prior to making the fexecveat syscall, and
always passing AT_EMPTY_PATH to the kernel) if desirable, so maybe it
doesn't make sense to have the kernel do it. In this sense the whole
"at" part of fexecveat becomes vestigial, though.

Any thoughts?
