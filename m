To illustrate the proposed use case I wrote a quick program that mmaps
a 5GB file which is filled with random data and accesses 150,000 pages
=66rom that mapping.  Setup and processing were timed separately to
illustrate the differences between the three tested approaches.  the
setup portion is simply the call to mmap, the processing is the
accessing of the various locations in  that mapping.  The following
values are in milliseconds and are the averages of 20 runs each with a
call to echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches between each run.

The first mapping was made with MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_LOCKED as a baseline:
Startup average:    9476.506
Processing average: 3.573

The second mapping was simply MAP_PRIVATE but each page was passed to
mlock() before being read:
Startup average:    0.051
Processing average: 721.859

The final mapping was MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_LOCKONFAULT:
Startup average:    0.084
Processing average: 42.125
