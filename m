Hmm. I wonder if we could move the handling into  handle_mm_fault() itself.

It's _fairly_ trivial to do on the arch side, just as long as you
remember to make the VM_FAULT_MAJOR bit sticky like x86 does with that

        major |= fault & VM_FAULT_MAJOR;

right after handle_mm_fault(). But it certainly doesn't seem like it
would be hard to move into common code in handle_mm_fault() either, by
just not doing the accounting if it's about to return VM_FAULT_RETRY
or VM_FAULT_ERROR.

That said, we want that perf_sw_event() accounting too, so we'd have
to pass in a 'struct regs *' as well. And it's not clear which way
accounting should go for other callers of handle_mm_fault() (ie gup
etc).

So I guess just having architectures fix it up individually and make
sure they don't do it for retry conditions is the right thing to do..
