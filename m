The support I have suggested and submitted for zone-less sections.
(In my add_persistent_memory() patchset)

Would work perfectly well and transparent for all such multimedia cases.
(All hacks removed). In fact I have loaded pmem (with-pages) on a VRAM
a few times and it is great easy fun. (I wanted to experiment with cached
memory over a pcie)

All this endless work for nothing more than uglyfing the Kernel, and
It will never end. When a real and fully working solution is right
here for more then a year.

If you are really up for a deep audit and a mammoth testing effort,
why not do a more worthy, and order of magnitude smaller work and support
2M and 1G variable sized "pages". All the virtual-vs-phisical-vs-caching
just works.

Most of the core work is there. Block layer and lots of other subsytems
already support sending a single page-pointer with bvec_offset bvec_len
bigger then 4K. Other system will be small fixes sprinkled around but
not at all this endless stream of subsystem after another of patches.
And for why.

The novelty of pages is the section object, the section is reached
from page* from virtual as well as physical planes. And is a center
that translate from all plains to all plains. You keep this concept
only make 2M-page sections and 1G-page sections.

It is a bit of work but is worth while, and accelerating tremendously
lots of workloads. Not like this abomination which only branches
things more and more, and making things fatter and slower.

It all feels like a typhoon, the inertia of tones and tons of
men hours work, in a huge wave. How will you ever stop such a
rushing mass. I'm trying to dock under but, surly it makes me sad.

Thanks
