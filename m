Good catch, I missed that because all other 64-bit architectures
have a statfs() call with 64-bit fields. I see that it also has an
osf_statfs64 structure and system call with lots of padding and some
oddly sized fields: f_type, f_flags and f_namemax are only 16 bits
wide, the rest is all 64-bit.

Adding the regular statfs64() should be easy enough, we just need to
decide which layout to use:

a) use the currently unused 'struct statfs64' as provided by the
    alpha uapi headers, which has a 32-bit __statfs_word but
    64-bit f_blocks, f_bfree, f_bavail, f_files, and f_ffree.

b) copy asm-generic/statfs.h to the alpha asm/statfs.h and
    change statfs64 to have the regular layout that we use
    on all other 64-bit architectures, using all 64-bit fields.

The other open question for alpha (as mentioned in one of the
patches I sent) would be whether to add get{eg,eu,g,p,pp,u}id()
with the regular calling conventions.
