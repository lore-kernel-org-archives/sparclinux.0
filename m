Ok.

Yes, that makes sense.

There is also the issue with the shift. See this thread for further
reference:

  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.DEB.2.20.1706282353190.1890@nanos

The gist is:

  "Anything using a shift value < 0 or > 31 will get crap as a
   result. Rightfully so because it's just undefined.

   Yes I know that the insanity of user space is unlimited, but anything
   attempting this is so broken that we cannot break it further by making
   that shift arg unsigned and actually limit it to 0-31"

So we should make that case explicit as well.

        if (encoded_op & (FUTEX_OP_OPARG_SHIFT << 28)) {
		if (oparg < 0 || oparg > 31)
			return -EINVAL;
                oparg = 1 << oparg;
	}

Thanks,
