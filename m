What is that for? Section type? Do we have more types or is it useless
and can go?

That section_type macro is actually saying the following code should
be in it. Can we make its name have a verb, i.e., something like
"set_section" to make it more clear?

Also, that type SECTION_TYPE_TABLES looks redundant to me but it
might start making more sense after I've gone through the rest of the
series...

And here's the confusion: there's "asmtype" but there's also
SECTION_TYPE_TABLES.

That asmtype is the *actual* section type in gas speak, i.e., @progbits,
@note, etc.

Now *that* should be your type. The SECTION_TYPE_TABLES should be called
something else or completely gone.

Btw, what does that macro do? I don't see it used anywhere.

Keeping different pieces of code in sync is always a PITA.

Can we automatically extract the kernel linker tables into a standalone
userspace pile of C code for experimentation? I.e., something like

make linker_tables_app

or so...

So this sounds to me like the main reason for linker tables is solving
the bitrot problem. And I don't think that is the main reason for them,
is it?

Because we can address the bitrot issue by simply building randconfigs,
without even touching the kernel. So why do we need those linker tables?

Ok, this is more like it. Linker tables actually diminish the Kconfig
complexity. I'd lead with that.

"fature" - please run it through spellchecker.

Btw, I'm afraid this "table-$(CONFIG" thing might be misused by people
wanting their stuff to be compile-tested and we'd end up practically
building an allyesconfig each time.

So how can I disable those table-* things from even getting built? Avoid
using table-y?

But then everything declared table-y will be built unconditionally. I don't
think I like that. :-\

Ok, so *this* is your main reason for linker tables - not fixing the
bit-rot problem. The text on the bit-rot problem should come second and
be the byproduct of linker tables.

Also, this section here should be the opening section in the document
explaining linker tables. I'd like to read about what it is first, then
read what else they're good for.

I'm assuming those are all needed and we're not adding them just for
completeness...

Otherwise, they'll bit-rot. :-))))
