I would hope so, my question was really on what CPU numbers you see. But 
I guess that 10, 11, 14, and 15?

As it should, scsi-mq only supports a single hw queue for now.

It could be. So we have tons of mappings from CPU10 to queue 0, but then 
we see this:

> [  256.236742] cpu: 10
> [  256.236749] queue: 809119744

and it turns to crap. This is pretty weird. Try with this debug patch - 
get rid of the other ones first. It should reduce your noise level too.
