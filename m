Yeah, but the following assumption are not true for sparc, parisc, and
even x86_32 so this ccp trick is not so useful:

/*
 * Normally, you have an iommu on 64 bit machines, but not on 32 bit
 * machines. Architectures that are differnt should override this.
*/

If we go with such approach, then we could use something like the
following. There are only two kinds of scatterlist definitions (use
dma_length or not) so we can cover all the architectures.
