The CONFIG_64BIT_TIME would do that nicely for the new stuff like
the conditional definition of __kernel_timespec, this one would get
removed after we convert all architectures.

A second issue is how to control the compilation of the compat syscalls.
CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME handles that and could be defined
in Kconfig as 'def_bool (!64BIT && CONFIG_64BIT_TIME) || COMPAT',
this is then just a more readable way of expressing exactly when the
functions should be built.

For completeness, there may be a third category, depending on how
we handle things like sys_nanosleep(): Here, we want the native
sys_nanosleep on 64-bit architectures, and compat_sys_nanosleep()
to handle the 32-bit time_t variant on both 32-bit and 64-bit targets,
but our plan is to not have a native 32-bit sys_nanosleep on 32-bit
architectures any more, as new glibc should call clock_nanosleep()
with a new syscall number instead. Should we then enclose
sys_nanosleep in "#if !defined(CONFIG_64BIT_TIME) ||
defined(CONFIG_64BIT)", or should we try to come up with another
Kconfig symbol name that expresses this better?
