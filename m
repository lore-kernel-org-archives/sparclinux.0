Something went wrong with quoting style in your reply.

It will be still wrong. The driver in question defines resource window based on
several parameters. So, this should be supplied with a real understanding of
all variety of hardware the certain driver serves for.

Just try to avoid

	foo(
		bar, ...

-like splitting.

No immediate suggestions.

uart_set_io_resource()
uart_clear_io_resource()

at least sounds more plausible to me.

Oh, then why it's in this function, which is *setter* according to its name,
at all?

Which is weird.

Just simple not touching it?

They do care. The driver on its own knows better than any generic code what
type of hardware it serves to.

See also above about naming patterns.

Then why it's not mentioned in the description of the function?
