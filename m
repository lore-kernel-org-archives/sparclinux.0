On sparc si_trapno is only set when SIGILL ILL_TRP is set.  So we can
limit si_trapno to that combination, and it should not be a problem for
a new signal/si_code pair to use that storage.  Precisely because it is
new.

Similarly on alpha si_trapno is only set for:

SIGFPE {FPE_INTOVF, FPE_INTDIV, FPE_FLTOVF, FPE_FLTDIV, FPE_FLTUND,
FPE_FLTINV, FPE_FLTRES, FPE_FLTUNK} and SIGTRAP {TRAP_UNK}.

Placing si_trapno into the union would also make the problem that the
union is pointer aligned a non-problem as then the union immediate
follows a pointer.

I hadn't had a chance to look before but we must deal with this.  The
definition of perf_sigtrap in 42dec9a936e7696bea1f27d3c5a0068cd9aa95fd
is broken on sparc, alpha, and ia64 as it bypasses the code in
kernel/signal.c that ensures the si_trapno or the ia64 special fields
are set.

Not to mention that perf_sigtrap appears to abuse si_errno.

The code is only safe if the analysis that says we can move si_trapno
and perhaps the ia64 fields into the union is correct.  It looks like
ia64 much more actively uses it's signal extension fields including for
SIGTRAP, so I am not at all certain the generic definition of
perf_sigtrap is safe on ia64.

If we localize the use of si_trapno to just a few special cases on alpha
and sparc I think we don't even need to worry about breaking userspace
on any architecture.  It will complicate siginfo_layout, but it is a
complication that reflects reality.

I don't have a clue how any of this affects ia64.  Does perf work on
ia64?  Does perf work on sparc, and alpha?

If perf works on ia64 we need to take a hard look at what is going on
there as well.
