Unlinking is not relevant. Magical symlinks refer to open file
descriptions (either real ones or O_PATH inode-reference-only ones),
not files. There is no new complexity proposed for freeing disk blocks
here. Semantics are identical to existing O_PATH inode references.

If you have a multithreaded process that's executing an external
program via fexecve, then unless it has specialized knowledge about
what other parts of the program/libraries are doing, it needs to be
using O_CLOEXEC for the file descriptor. Otherwise, the file
descriptor could be leaked to child processes started by other
threads. This is what I mean by the "intended idiom". Note that it's
easier to use pathnames instead of fexecve, but doing so may not be an
option if the program needs to verify the file before exec'ing it.

This issue can be avoided if you're going to fork-and-fexecve rather
than replacing the calling process, since after forking it's safe to
remove the close-on-exec flag. But then you still have the issue that
the child process, after exec, keeps a spurious file descriptor to its
own process image (executable file) open which it can never close
(because it doesn't know the number). This could eventually lead to fd
exhaustion after many generations.

The "magic open-once magic symlink" approach is really the cleanest
solution I can find. In the case where the interpreter does not open
the script, nothing terribly bad happens; the magic symlink just
sticks around until _exit or exec. In the case where the interpreter
opens it more than once, you get a failure, but as far as I know
existing interpreters don't do this, and it's arguably bad design. In
any case it's a caught error.
