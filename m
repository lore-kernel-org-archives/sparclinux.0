Yeah, I think I just wrote that wrong, it's only relevant for scripts.
As Rich says, for normal binaries argv[0] is just the argv[0] that
was passed into the execve[at] call.  For a script, the code in
fs/binfmt_script.c will remove the original argv[0] and put the
interpreter name and the script filename (e.g. "/bin/sh",
"/dev/fd/6/script") in as 2 arguments in its place.

[As an aside, IIRC the filename does get put into the new
process's memory, up above the environment strings -- but
that copy isn't visible via argv nor envp.]

I may be misremembering, but I thought we hoped to be able to fix
execveat of a script without /proc in future, but didn't expect to fix
execveat of a script via an O_CLOEXEC fd (because in the latter
case the fd gets closed before the script interpreter runs, so even
if the interpreter (or a special filesystem) does clever things for names
starting with "/dev/fd/..." the file descriptor is already gone).
