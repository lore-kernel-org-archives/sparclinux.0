OK I've put this whole series in a branch with the acks we have so far.

I'll ask Stephen to put it in linux-next once 4.3-rc1 is out, and I'll ask
Linus to pull it for 4.4

I haven't published the branch yet, so if the s390 and sparc maintainers want
to send me acks I'll rebase and add them.

cheers
