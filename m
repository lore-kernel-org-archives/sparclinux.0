Resending the patch cover letter for vger only as it didn't reach there for 
some reason (# recipients maybe?).

+++++++++++
This is a first series of patches to remove trailing spaces in messages. 
Patches cover arch-specific code plus one fix for PM and one in 
Documentation. Depending on how this series is received I'll continue
with other parts of the kernel.

Benefits are:
- general cleanup and consistency
- minor reduction in kernel size and user's log file size
- reduced annoyance for people writing logcheck rules

The patch for m68k has been rebased against linux-next; all other
patches apply against both mainline and -next (as of 5-2).
