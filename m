3, definitely, and instead of having to invent a new scheme for every
new syscall, make that the default pattern by providing a helper

int __copy_abi_struct(void *kernel, size_t ksize, const void __user
*user, size_t usize)
{
	size_t copy = min(ksize, usize);

	if (copy_from_user(kernel, user, copy))
		return -EFAULT;

	if (usize > ksize) {
		/* maybe a separate "return user_is_zero(user + ksize, usize -
ksize);" helper */
		char c;
		user += ksize;
		usize -= ksize;
		while (usize--) {
			if (get_user(c, user++))
				return -EFAULT;
			if (c)
				return -EINVAL;
		}
	} else if (ksize > usize) {
		memset(kernel + usize, 0, ksize - usize);
	}
	return 0;
}
#define copy_abi_struct(kernel, user, usize)	\
	__copy_abi_struct(kernel, sizeof(*kernel), user, usize)

I don't see how 3 is cumbersome to use directly. Userspace code does
struct openat_of_the_day args = {.field1 = x, .field3 = y} and passes
&args, sizeof(args). What does glibc need to do beyond its usual munging
of the userspace ABI registers to the syscall ABI registers?
