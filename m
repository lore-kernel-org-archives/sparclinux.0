Hello all:

It seems no any additional rejections for it. I guess, I need split the
'big' patch into pieces, and each send to its' related mailing list, so
let it not like a spam. And the schedule may like:

 - Firstly, send patch for "init/Kconfig" to add CPU_*_ENDIAN. If pass
   checking (hope it can be passed checking), then

 - Send each related patch to each related architectures which already
   knew their ENDIAN attributes in config time (24 patches, I guess),
   then

 - Make patch for Kbuild to support __BUILDING_TIME_BIG_ENDIAN__, and
   pass checking (hope I can finish), then

 - Finish left architectures which need __BUILDING_TIME_BIG_ENDIAN__
   (4 patches, I guess).

Welcome any ideas, suggestions, or completions. And if no additional
reply, I shall not send any additional information any more to avoid
spam to other members.


Thanks.
