Why pad the structure when new functionality (perhaps accommodated via
a larger structure) could be signaled by passing a new flag? Adding
reserved fields to a structure with a size embedded in the ABI makes a
lot of sense --- e.g., pthread_mutex_t can't grow. But this structure
can grow, so the reservation seems needless to me.
