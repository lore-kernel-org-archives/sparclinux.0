Indeed, and I'm not proposing to get rid of that. It's the grossly
over-engineered array of operations and the FUTEX_OP_OPARG_SHIFT modifier
that I think we should kill. The latter likely behaves differently across
different architectures and potentially depending on the toolchain you used
to build the kernel.

Does anybody know the history behind the interface design?
