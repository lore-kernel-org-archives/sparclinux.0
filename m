Not really true any more - I only base -mm patches on linux-next
patches when they must be based that way due to some known dependency.

I can certainly handle MM patches which are based on linux-next.  Such
an arrangement is going to make life awkward for Michal's
auto-maintained git tree of the -mm MM patches
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mhocko/mm.git).

Maybe I could merge down_write_killable into -mm's main MM section then
knock it out of my copy of linux-next, so everything is seamless for
mm.git.  I've done that before.

But it's all a bit of a pain - it would be simpler to keep
down_write_killable in the same tree as the patches which depend on it.


Michal, how about this?

mm.git currently takes the patches between

#NEXT_PATCHES_START mm
...
#NEXT_PATCHES_END


Can you change it to also take the patches between

#NEXT_PATCHES_START mm-post-next
...
#NEXT_PATCHES_END

?

That way I can do


#NEXT_PATCHES_START mm
...
#NEXT_PATCHES_END
...
linux-next.patch
revert-down_write_killable.patch
...
#NEXT_PATCHES_START mm-post-next
down_write_killlable.patch
...
#NEXT_PATCHES_END

then everything you have should apply and run OK.
