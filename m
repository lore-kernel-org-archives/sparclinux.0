Well yeah?

It does, but it would be mechanical, so in theory at least it should be a safe.

That patch could also go in a full release before the others, giving us the
maximum opportunity to test.

Right. But each maintainer could take the patch for their arch and merge it as
they see fit.

The main advantage though would be if regressions are found we could revert
just the patch for a particular arch, rather than having to back out the whole
thing - which would be basically impossible.

Agreed.

The other problem if it's monolithic is who's tree does it go into? I guess
Andrews.
