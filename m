Hi David,

I have found that on my sun4c, I need to increase the ESP_BUS_TIMEOUT from 
250ms to 275ms when I build the ESP driver into the kernel or the ESP 
does not find the disk.

If I build the driver as a module, this extra 25ms is not required. Any 
idears?

Given that the V1 EPS driver used 275ms and the 250ms is only recommended 
(SCSI II Std. ISO-IEC-9316-1995), should the ESP_BUS_TIMEOUT be changed 
back to 275ms?

Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
