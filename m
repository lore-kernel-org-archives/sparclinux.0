Isn't this __clear_user() exactly (perhaps except for the return value)?
Perhaps not every arch has that?

Eh, I'd avoid abs() here due to the funkiness of the implicit type
conversions - ksize-usize has type size_t, then that's coerced to an int
(or a long maybe?), the abs is applied which return an int/long (or
unsigned versions?). Something like "rest = max(ksize, usize) - size;"
is more obviously correct and doesn't fall into any
narrowing/widening/sign extending traps.

Please don't. That is a restriction on all future extensions - once a
kernel is shipped with a syscall using this helper with that arbitrary
restriction in place, that syscall is forever prevented from extending
its arg struct beyond PAGE_SIZE (which is arch-dependent anyway). Sure,
it's hard to imagine, but who'd have thought 32 O_* or CLONE_* bits
weren't enough for everybody?

This is only for future compatibility, and if someone runs an app
compiled against 7.3 headers on a 5.4 kernel, they probably don't care
about performance, but they would like their app to run.

[If we ever create such a large ABI struct that doesn't fit on stack,
we'd have to extend our API a little to create a dup_struct_from_user()
that does the kmalloc() for us and then calls copy_struct_from_user() -
but we might want that long before we hit PAGE_SIZE structs].

I think that could simply be __clear_user().

I think I understand why you put this last instead of handling the
buffer in the "natural" order. However,
I'm wondering whether we should actually do this copy before checking
that the extra kernel bytes are 0 - the user will still be told that
there was some extra information via the -EFBIG/-E2BIG return, but maybe
in some cases the part he understands is good enough. But I also guess
we have to look to existing users to see whether that would prevent them
from being converted to using this helper.

linux-api folks, WDYT?

> +	return 0;

Maybe more useful to "return size;", some users might want to know/pass
on how much was actually copied.

Can't we wait with this until a modular user shows up? The primary users
are syscalls, which can't be modular AFAIK.

As above.

As above.

I'd create a __user_is_zero() helper for this - that way the two
branches in the two helpers become nicely symmetric, each just calling a
single helper that deals appropriately with the tail. And we can discuss
how to implement __user_is_zero() in another bikeshed.

If you do move up the __copy_to_user(), please move this as well - on
the kernel side, we certainly don't care that we copied some bytes to a
local buffer which we then ignore because the user had a non-zero tail.
But if __copy_to_user() is kept last in copy_struct_to_user(), this
should stay for symmetry.

As above.
