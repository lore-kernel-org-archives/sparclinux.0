OK, so this has passed my defconfig and allnoconfig for xtensa compile
test, allyesconfig has failed due to some unrelated reasons:
clk-qoriq.c:(.init.text+0x3ebd3): dangerous relocation: l32r: literal target out of range (try using text-section-literals): (.init.literal+0x17c60)
and zillions of similar... The same error is without the patch

I do not have a crosscompiler[1] for sh arch so I couldn't have tested
it but there shouldn't be any issues in principal. I will send two
patches as a follow up.
