Sure we care about eliminating fragility, and usage does not seem to be widespread 
at all:

 triton:~/tip> git grep -w use_mm

 drivers/staging/rdma/hfi1/user_sdma.c:          use_mm(req->pq->user_mm);
 drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_fs.c:             use_mm(io_data->mm);
 drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c:      use_mm(mm);
 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:  use_mm(dev->mm);

I think we also want to keep our general flexibility wrt. eventually turning the 
mmap_sem into a spinlock ...

Not all syscalls are interruptible - for example sys_sync() isn't:

SYSCALL_DEFINE0(sync)
{
        int nowait = 0, wait = 1;

        wakeup_flusher_threads(0, WB_REASON_SYNC);
        iterate_supers(sync_inodes_one_sb, NULL);
        iterate_supers(sync_fs_one_sb, &nowait);
        iterate_supers(sync_fs_one_sb, &wait);
        iterate_bdevs(fdatawrite_one_bdev, NULL);
        iterate_bdevs(fdatawait_one_bdev, NULL);
        if (unlikely(laptop_mode))
                laptop_sync_completion();
        return 0;
}

So my problem as I see it is the following: you are adding a rare API to an 
already complex locking interface, further complicating already complicated MM 
code paths in various ways. Only to help a case that is a third type of rare: 
OOM-kill.

That's a surefire whack-a-mole nest of bugs, if I've ever seen one.

What I am suggesting instead is a slight modification of the concept: to re-phrase 
the problem set and think in broader terms of interruptability: make certain MM 
operations, especially ones which tend to hinder OOM-kill latencies, more 
interruptible - which implicitly also makes them more OOM-killable.

That's a win-win as I see it: as both your usecase and a lot of other usecases 
will be improved - and it will also be tested a lot more than any OOM-kill path 
will be tested.

I might be wrong in the end, but your counterarguments were not convincing so far 
(to me).

Thanks,

	Ingo
