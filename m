I am not sure if I care too much about arc and ppc32 which are pretty much legacy
platforms.

Another option maybe to get some decent arches on board first before merging this
thing, so it have more changes to catch regressions for developers who might run this.

Hmm, that is pretty weak where s390 is not even official supported with this version.

I am thinking about how we made so many mistakes before by merging too many of
those debugging options that many of them have been broken for many releases
proving that nobody actually used them regularly. We don’t need to repeat the same
mistake again. I am actually thinking about to remove things like  page_poisoning often
which is almost are never found any bug recently and only cause pains when interacting
with other new features that almost nobody will test them together to begin with.
We even have some SLUB debugging code sit there for almost 15 years that almost
nobody used it and maintainers refused to remove it.

I am thinking exactly the other way around. You are proposing to merge this tests
without proving how useful it will be able to find regressions for future developers
to make sure it will actually get used.
