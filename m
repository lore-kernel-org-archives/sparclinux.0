Looks like it is stuck on hidp_session_sem.

Nothing after 2.6.21 seems to have even touched that semaphore usage, and 
in fact there's not a whole lot of changes to the hidp code at all (and 
none of them look even remotely interesting). 

So I suspect it's something lower down in the bluetooth stack, or it's a 
long-standing problem that you are somehow able to trigger more easily 
now. Is it consistent?

Can you showo the traces for the _other_ processes that are in bluetooth 
functions? Because there should be other processes there, holding that 
hidp_session_sem rwsem.

[ Alternatively, there is some process that doesn't release it in an error 
  case, but that is definitely not a regression if so: the changes to 
  net/bluetooth/hidp/core.c since 2.6.21 really are trivial. ]

IOW, more info needed, I think.
