More that sucks, it is just plain *wrong*.  :-)

so, to sum up, of_pdt_build_tree goes through the following process:

1) dp = of_pdt_create_node
  - dp->name = of_pdt_get_one_property(node, "name"); /* name w/o addr */

2) (SPARC) dp->path_component_name = build_path_component(dp);
  - format <node name>@<address>
  - uses dp->name value
  - not on OLPC

3) dp->full_name = of_pdt_build_full_name(dp)
  - (SPARC) use dp->path_component_name
  - (OLPC) depend on value from of_pdt_try_pkg2path(node);
  - (others) fake it with an incorrect value?

Am I correct?

Faking it is clearly not acceptable.  The solution is to *force* all
platforms to implement a method for obtaining the full path.  That
means BUG() or WARN() if pkg2path is not populated, or if it returns
NULL.  It also means no mucking about with of_pdt_try_pkg2path().
Call ops->pkg2path directly and complain loudly when it does not work.

I see two choices:
1) implement ops->pkg2path for SPARC, but back it with
   build_path_component() instead of a call to OF
2) #ifdef of_pdt_build_full_name() to use the current behaviour for
   SPARC, but call pkg2path for everyone else.

Actually, I'd like to see build_path_component() refactored to return
the full_name instead.  It is trivial to get the path component from
the full name at any time, but it is not trivial to go the other
direction.... but that is probably more surgery than should be done in
this immediate bug-fix.  I'm assuming a fix is necessary before 2.6.38
is finalized?
