was it painful because of sparc environment?
fedora/ubuntu on x86 ship with modern clang already and bpf backend
is compiled-in by default.
redhat folks have been back and forth on adding bpf support to gcc.
The backend itself was fully functional before it was abandoned.
Last time we discussed it the lack of integrated asm in gcc was the main blocker.
Can we bend gcc rules and let bpf backend emit custom binary and/or elf?
