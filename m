Less information than I had hoped :-/

I thought it was hanging "during boot" meaning before we try to
execute userspace.  When in fact it seems to die exactly when we start
running the init process.

Wrt. disassembly of fault_in_user_windows(), that's not likely the
cause because if it were being miscompiled it would equally not work
on the other systems.

Something in the UltraSPARC-III specific code paths is going wrong
(either it is miscompiled, or the code makes an assumption that isn't
valid which has happened in the past).

Do you happen to have both gcc-4.9 and a previously working compiler
on these systems?  If you do, we can build a kernel with gcc-4.9 and
then selectively compile certain failes with the older working
compiler to narrow down what compiles into something non-working with
gcc-4.9

I would start with the following files:

	arch/sparc/mm/init_64.c
	arch/sparc/mm/tlb.c
	arch/sparc/mm/tsb.c
	arch/sparc/mm/fault_64.c

And failing that, go for various files under arch/sparc/kernel/ such as:

	arch/sparc/kernel/process_64.c
	arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c
	arch/sparc/kernel/sys_sparc_64.c
	arch/sparc/kernel/sys_sparc32.c
	arch/sparc/kernel/traps_64.c

Hopefully, this should be a simply matter of doing a complete build
with gcc-4.9, then removing the object file we want to selectively
build with the older compiler and then going:

	make CC="gcc-4.6" arch/sparc/mm/init_64.o

then relinking with plain 'make'.

If the build system rebuilds the object file on you when you try
to relink the final kernel image, we'll have to do some of this
by hand to make the test.

Thanks.
