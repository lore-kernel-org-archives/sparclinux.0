But that only pertains to the code that was modified to be used with
the Linux kernel, right? That is, if there's a BSD licensed module for
device FOO, and I port it to the Linux kernel, that will need to have a
GPL added to it to be included in Linux. But the original BSD code is
not affected. If a fix is made to the GPL Linux version, I'm assuming
(because I've been asked when doing something like this), that the
author of that fix will have to give it a dual license to be used back
in the original BSD only code. Correct?

I'm just trying to understand this. From what would make sense to me
(but may or may not to a court of law, where it counts), is that the
code added to Linux must be under GPL. But using that code depends on
where you get it from. If you use BSD source, it stays under BSD. But
any fixes to the GPL version will require permission to be put back to
the BSD version. A change to the GPL version doesn't automatically get
allowed back to the BSD only version?
