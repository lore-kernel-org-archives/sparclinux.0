Overall I'm in favor of this patch, and it's close to what I had in
mind in the commit message for
00b73d8d1b7131da03aec73011a7286f566fe87f. But I'd actually like to see
it go further. These ops are mainly (only?) used for the (almost never
used) FUTEX_WAKE_OP operation, and there's very little sense in trying
to optimize them with dedicated arch-specific forms like "lock xadd".
Instead the entire logic should be in an arch-generic file, and all
the arch should need to provide is a cmpxchg-on-user-memory primitive
for it to use. On most archs, the same cmpxchg used in kernelspace
should also work for user addresses, meaning a huge amount of
unmaintained, largely untested, junk code can be removed.
