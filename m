To start with the test uses struct page with mk_pte() and mk_pmd() while
pfn gets used in pfn_pud() during pXX_basic_tests(). So we will not be able
to derive a valid struct page from a synthetic pfn. Also if synthetic pfn is
going to be used anyway then why derive it from a real kernel symbol like
kernel_init(). Could not one be just made up with right alignment ?

Currently the test allocates 'mm_struct' and other page table pages from real
memory then why should it use synthetic pfn while creating actual page table
entries ? Couple of benefits going with synthetic pfn will be..

- It simplifies the test a bit removing PUD_SIZE allocation helpers
- It might enable the test to be run on systems without adequate memory

In the current proposal the allocation happens during boot making it much more
likely to succeed than not and when it fails, respective tests will be skipped.

I am just wondering if being able to run complete set of tests on smaller
systems with less memory weighs lot more in favor of going with synthetic
pfn instead.
