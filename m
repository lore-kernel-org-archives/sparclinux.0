The code is generic it just happens those functions are only used on
sparc and alpha.  Further I really want to make filling out siginfo_t
happen in dedicated functions as much as possible in kernel/signal.c.
The probably of getting it wrong without a helper functions is very
strong.  As the code I am fixing demonstrates.

The IS_ENABLED(arch) is mostly there so we can delete the code if/when
the architectures are retired in another decade or so.

As it happens the floating point emulation code on alpha is inconsistent
with the non floating point emulation code.  When using real floating
point hardware SIGFPE on alpha always set si_trapno.  The floating point
emulation code does not look like it has ever set si_trapno.

I continued to used send_sig_fault_trapno to point out that
inconsistency.

If alpha floating point emulation was in active use I expect we would
care enough to put something other than 0 in there.

If the breakage that came with SIGTRAP TRAP_PERF had not been discovered
during the merge window I would not be sending this now.  It took a
little time to dig to the bottom, then the code needed just a little
extra time to sit, so there were not surprises.

As for mixing things, I am not quite certain what you are referring to.
All of the changes relate to keeping people from shooting themselves
in the foot with when using siginfo.

The most noise comes from send_sig_fault vs send_sig_fault_trapno, and
force_sig_fault vs force_sig_fault_trapno.  That is fundamental to the
siginfo fix as it is there to ensure that is safe to treat si_trapno
as an ordinary _sigfault union member.  Which in turns makes alpha
and sparc no longer special with respect to _sigfault, just a little
eccentric.

I will concede that renaming SIL_PERF_EVENT to SIL_FAULT_PERF_EVENT is
unnecessary, but it certainly makes it clear that we are dealing
with _sigfault and not some other part of siginfo_t.
