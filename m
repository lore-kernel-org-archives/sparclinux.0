This is the module tag ... it says what licence the module is under,
not the licence for the module combined with the kernel, which is
always GPLv2 because the stricter licence rules.

I don't follow you here.  We do have separate Dual licence tags. Dual
BSD/GPL allows me to do this today, without waiting fifteen years.  I
think you're conflating two issues:

   1. The licence of the actual module, which must be compatible with the
      kernel to do an insmod. =C2=A0This is actually what MODULE_LICENSE
      declares
   2. The conditions the creation of the combined work imposes on me

It's the latter, even in the case of Dual BSD/GPL which still requires
me to release source code, so the combination with the kernel forces
GPL conditions even in the case of a BSD module (which is otherwise
compatible) and even after 15 years of this copyleft-next.

The point is: I can create a pure BSD module.  You can pick it up and
put it into the kernel source as Dual BSD/GPL, because BSD allows this,
but I'm still free to create binary only versions under BSD (as long as
they're for something other than inserting into Linux).  However, if I
want my binary only modules to be combined with Linux, I have to follow
GPLv2 compliance because GPLv2 becomes the ruling licence of the
combination.  The same would apply to this copyleft-next, even after 15
years.

A reasonable person would take GPL to mean any version of GPL.

What you describe is how it's always worked.  You may always distribute
a compatibly licensed piece of code under the stricter licence.=20
 Additional permissions are always strippable in GPLv3 terms.

The US copyright office defines a copyright work as anything which is
"an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
expression".  That means any change to an existing work (i.e. by a
patch) which contains enough originality to make the changed work
distinct from the old work is ipso facto a new work.  under copyright
-next this new work has a sunset 15 years from its creation by
combination, not 15 years from the original.  This means a constantly
updated work never sunsets.  Sure, you can go back 15 years and claim
the code at that time has passed into the public domain but you can't
do that if you also want the benefit of later changes.
