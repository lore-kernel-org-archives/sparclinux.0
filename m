I was talking in terms of changes made, not lines changed: by my
recollection, about a third of the patches didn't touch flush calls
and most of the lines changed looked like refactoring so that making
the flush call conditional would be easier.

I guess it smelled like you were doing lots of distinct changes in a
single patch and I got my numbers wrong.

My point is that there's a couple of patches that only remove
BUG_ON()s, which implies that for that particular driver it doesn't
matter if there's a physical page or not, so therefore that code is
purely "documentation".

Thanks,
