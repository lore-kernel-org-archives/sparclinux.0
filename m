So in a nutshell, this is supposed to be the (writer) rwsem counterpart of
mutex_lock_killable() and down_killable(), right?

fwiw I'm not a fan of the _state naming. While I understand why you chose it, I feel
it does not really describe the purpose of the call itself. The state logic alone is
really quite small and therefore should not govern the function name. Why not just apply
kiss and label things _common, ie like mutexes do? This would also standardize names a
bit.

                           ^^ unlikely()?

If the lock is highly contended + a bad workload for spin-on-owner, this could take a while :)
Of course, this is a side effect of the wait until no active lockers optimization which avoids
the wait_lock in the first place, so fortunately it somewhat mitigates the situation.

You certainly don't want this iff exiting due to TASK_KILLABLE situation.
