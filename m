I don't mind changing to the try-for-ownership model for rwsem and
mutex. I do have some concern to do that for spinlock. Some of the lock
slowpath code do optimistic trylock. Making them unconditional cmpxchg
will impact lock contention performance.

I will update this rwsem patch to make the change while I am working on
it. For other locks, I will suggest we go slow and carefully evaluate
the performance implication before we make the changes.
