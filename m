It is broken on Sparc64 even without boundary restrictions --- if you skip 
over already allocated entry in IOMMU table, you don't merge too.

I'd just drop it, because these requirements seem to me too brittle to 
maintain. It is too easy to make bug here and too hard to check for it. 
Basically there are few independent code parts (I/O layer and 
arch-specific IOMMUs) that are attempting to do the same calculation and 
if they differ, the driver will crash. Even if we managed to fix it, 
someone will likely break it again after year or two :-(

Would it mean that nr_hw_segments entry in bio and request could be 
dropped too? Or is it used for some other purpose?


BTW.: what's the reason that by default (without any driver intervention) 
device DMA is restricted to cross 64k boundary?
