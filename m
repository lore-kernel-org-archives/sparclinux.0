The thread pointer stored by one of the cpus is garbage.  It's being
inspected in %g3 at this point on the cpu which triggered the
backtrace.  It just tested it for NULL, which passed, so then we trust
it as a good kernel pointer but it's not, it's 000007f300000001.

And we take the unaligned trap when we try to dereference that thing.

Looking at the code which collects these registers, the bug is clear.
In arch/sparc/mm/ultra.S:xcall_fetch_glob_regs we go:

	sethi		%hi(global_reg_snapshot), %g1
	or		%g1, %lo(global_reg_snapshot), %g1
	__GET_CPUID(%g2)
	sllx		%g2, 6, %g3
	add		%g1, %g3, %g1

so far so good, %g2 holds the current cpu's number, and %g1 now holds
a pointer to the global_reg_snapshot entry we'll fill in.

But later in this routine:

	rdpr		%cwp, %g2
	sub		%g2, 1, %g7
	wrpr		%g7, %cwp
	mov		%i7, %g7
	wrpr		%g2, %cwp
	stx		%g7, [%g1 + GR_SNAP_RPC]

which on the surface looks fine, but the problem is we've clobbered
%g2 and then afterwards we go:

	sethi		%hi(trap_block), %g7
	or		%g7, %lo(trap_block), %g7
	sllx		%g2, TRAP_BLOCK_SZ_SHIFT, %g2
	add		%g7, %g2, %g7
	ldx		[%g7 + TRAP_PER_CPU_THREAD], %g3
	stx		%g3, [%g1 + GR_SNAP_THREAD]

This code assumes %g2 still holds the current cpu's number in it, but
as stated it's been clobbered with the %cwp read above.

That's why we read a garbage thread pointer, the index we use into
trap_block[] is wrong.

I'll work on a fix for this, thanks for the report.
