As we're now at -rc7 I'd prefer to take a look at all of this after the
3.7 release - please resend everything shortly after 3.8-rc1.

Please include the rationale within each version of the patchset rather
than by linking to an old email.  Because

a) this way, more people are likely to read it

b) it permits the text to be maimtained as the code evolves

c) it permits the text to be included in the mainlnie commit, where
   people can find it.

What's happening with the acpi framework?  has it received any feedback
from the ACPI developers?
