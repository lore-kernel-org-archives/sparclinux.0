You shouldn't be getting the unaligned fixup in the first place,
especially in the locations where you see them.  I suspect that
once you see first fixup, all of the registers in the cpu have
been corrupted in one way or another.

I suspect something fundamental gets corrupted, for example the
current register window (%cwp) is corrupted and that screws up all of
the registers so every single function starts accessing garbage.

My suspicions lie in three places, the ftrace mcount()
stubs, stack_trace_flush(), or the new perf_arch_save_caller_regs()
since those are the three places offhand that could make
us potentially make us return to function in the wrong
register window.
