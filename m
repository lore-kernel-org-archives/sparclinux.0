Ok, now that I mentioned about my patch, let me as well show it some daylight..
It is totally untested, incomplete and probably won't even compile.. (given
that I had abandoned working on it some time ago, since I was not sure in
what direction the async boot design was headed, which was the original
motivation for me to try to fix this race)

I really hate to post it when it is in such a state, but atleast let me get
the idea out, now that the discussion is around it, atleast just to get some
thoughts about whether it is even worth pursuing! 
(I'll post the patches as a reply to this mail.)

By the way, it should solve the powerpc boot failure, atleast in principle,
considering what the root cause of the failure was..
