Incidentally I'm happy to have been CC'd since this infrastructure is
_really_ nice for doing things generically with device tree. The
ability to add new linker-section-based tables without having to
manually hack up linker script templates will make it so we can do
things like adding tables for cache controllers or mmus (that are
needed quite early in init and can't go through the platform device
system).

BTW we kinda lucked out that there was already the linker table
infrastructure for cpu enable methods for smp; this patch series makes
it so future stuff doesn't have to rely on luck or invasive changes.
