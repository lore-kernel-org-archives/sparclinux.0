I'd clearly got brain-fade there, mcast bit is the first transmitted bit
(on ethernet) but the bytes are sent LSB first (like async).

Followed by a branch that might be marked 'assume taken' so the
normal path takes the branch.
I guess that is followed by 'add 1 to %g1', 'stx %g1, [ %l1 + 0x168 ]'
and a branch to 3530.
GCC must be using that condition to generate get the bottom of a loop
to 'fallthrough' to its top!

My version should generate something like:
		ldub  [ %g2 + %g3 ], %g1
		ldx   [ %l1 + 0x168 ], %g2
		and   1, %g1
		add   %g1, %g2, %g2
		stx   %g2, [ %l1 + 0x168 ]
While this looks like 5 instructions (rather than 2) it has fewer pipeline
stalls and can be 'spread out' into the surrounding lines of code to
reduce the stalls further.

On x86 gcc is likely to ignore the 'unlikely' and generate a forwards
(predicted not taken) branch around the increment.
I've had to but asm comments in the else part of conditionals like
that to force gcc to generate a forwards jump to the 'unlikely' statements.
