Isn't it reason enough for customers to use it? How will a customer 
capture even an OOPS meesage? Lets say some web server crashed and OOPs 
message did not make it to logs. I am not expecting a customer to setup
a console for each and every machine in the network. In this scenario
customer will have no choice but to reset the machine without any
information about why did machine crash.

If one can keep kdump configured, upon a crash there are high chances
that customer will have some debug information to look at. I agree that
security of data can be a concern. In that case probably one can extract
a small dump report, like OOPs message, messages in the kernel buffers
just before crash etc. and report it to service folks. 

Without kdump, customer will most likely have no debug data except a
complain that system crashed and rebooted or it had to be reset by manual
intervention.
