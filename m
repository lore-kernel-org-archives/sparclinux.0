Thanks for doing this ... we'd never have found it by looking at the
driver code ...

Reading the code for this, it seems that something fiddled with the
IRQ_DISABLED or IRQ_PENDING flags when it came time for the ->eoi() so
the gem interrupt is always held pending (because it's never ended).

Since the sym2 is on interrupts 16 and 17 and gem on 11 (and the
descriptors are separate entities in the irq_desc array) I can't really
see how sym2 would be doing this.
