Actually, ext4 doesn't trigger the problem because the on-stack object
used in ext4 is a fixed size at compile time.  Which is technically an
ill-advised assumption to make.  Even the generic libcrc32c.c doesn't
assume that the context area is 4 bytes for crc32c.

Anyways, back to the main point, the gcc bug only triggers when
alloca() like constructs are used.

That's why I scanned for SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK() to see exactly where
the workaround is necessary.
