There should not be an OOPS, we don't map any section of the
kernel as read-only or execute-only or anything like that.

The kernel image is mapped with full read/write/execute permission.

So even writes to so-called 'read-only' sections of the kernel image
will work and therefore I don't understand what the bug could be other
than the compiler "optimizing" away the write to the constant string
in which case the compiler should have warned about it.
