What would we need to do to get all architectures using the new
interfaces, and remove __ARCH_WANT_OLD_COMPAT_IPC?

Regarding the implementation: rather than patching the header
files, it would be more conventional (and arguably better) to add

	select ARCH_WANT_OLD_COMPAT_IPC

to arch/*/Kconfig, then use CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_OLD_COMPAT_IPC.
