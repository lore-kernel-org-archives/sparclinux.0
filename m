Yeah, so let's make it clear that this is similar to COMPILE_TEST and
people with fast machines and who don't mind building a couple more
seconds longer, should enable it.

You don't want to be doing bit-rotting tests on small, weak machines,
which barely get done with the build as it is. I have a 32-bit atom
which takes hours to build a kernel. Enabling that there is not making
the kernel build any more fun.

No, the reason is we don't force stuff down people's throats just
because we think we know better. Other people do that.

Instead, we help them make an informed decision by describing the
feature as precisely as possible.
