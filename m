Not that I know of, but I do have an incriminating email from you where
you promise to pick up the pieces if anything explodes ;-)

There've also been commits from Jens, Boaz and Tomo that could plausibly
be related (I think we can discount the one from Adrian).  Meelis, can
you run through the various patches to qlogicpti, backing them out one
at a time?  I worry that some infrastructure may have been taken away by
followups to these patches, so it may not be feasible.
