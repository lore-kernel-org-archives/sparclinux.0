Do you mean users who move 32-bit binaries (without recompiling) to a
new x64 kernel? Does the kernel guarantees that to work? I'd personally
care more native-bitness apps.

TBH, this won't fix that entirely (e.g. passing non-compat io_uring
to a compat process should yield the same problem). So, let's put
it aside for now until this bikeshedding would be relevant.

Yes, something like that, but that's not automatic and in some
(hopefully rare) cases there may be pitfalls. That's in short,
I can expand the idea a bit if anyone would be interested.

Well, not everyone _have_ to implement such a fallback, e.g.
applications working only whilst privileged may use SQPOLL only.
