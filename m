I agree, that something needs to be said. What I instead did was 
added "See BUGS" to the ENOEXEC error, and then this text:

   BUGS
       The  ENOENT  error  described above means that it is not possible
       possible to set the close-on-exec flag  on  the  file  descriptor
       given to a call of the form:

           execveat(fd, "", argv, envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH);

       However, the inability to set the close-on-exec flag means that a
       file descriptor referring to the  script  leaks  through  to  the
       script  itself.  As well as wasting a file descriptor, this leak‐
       age can lead to file-descriptor  exhaustion  in  scenarios  where
       scripts  recursively  employ  exceveat()  (or a future fexecve(3)
       implementation that might be based on execveat()).

Okay?

Thanks,

Michael
