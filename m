given that this fixes a data corruption issue, wouldnt it be the best to go forward
with this patch ASAP and then handle the other patches on top with all the time that
we need?

this is region/segment table entry according to the architecture. 
On our platform we do have the pagetables with a different format that
next levels (segment table -> 1MB granularity, region 3rd table -> 2 GB
granularity, region 2nd table -> 4TB granularity, region 1st table -> 8 PB
granularity. ST,R3,R2,R1 have the same format and are thus often called
crste (combined region and segment table entry).
