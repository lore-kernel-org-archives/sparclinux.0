interesting...
It should pick up local headers without touching /usr/include.
In the past I used to do 'make headers_install' before doing a build
in samples/bpf or selftests, but then suddenly it started working
without that step, so I figured something got fixed in the build system.
May be it's arch specific somehow.

of course I agree :) That would be ideal. Just so far no one hacked BFD.
