I never suggested this.  Although I do support inlining the
cases which merely adjust the ordering of arguments being
passed to function calls, because such inlines are essentially
of zero cost and of gain to all platforms.

I stated my suggested alternative to this in another posting, so of
course I do not support it as-is.
