Seems nice. Do you even need this unique ID thing? AFAIKS the name
would never really be useful.

It could perhaps go into a cold data section too, I assume the common
case is that you do not access it. Although gcc will end up putting
the file and function names into regular rodata.

Possibly we could add a printk specifier for it, pass it through to
existing BUG, etc macros that want exactly this, etc. Makes a lot of
sense.

Thanks,
