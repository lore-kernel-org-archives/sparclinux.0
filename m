FWIW, I personally haven't tested this driver in a long time, did
anyone give it at least a simple test when you made those
->slave_configure changes to this driver?

I'm talking about this one:

commit 9ec76fbf7d6da3e98070a7059699d0ca019b0c9b

    [SCSI] qlogicpti: Add a slave_configure method
    
    By configuring targets in slave_configure, we can eliminate a shadow
    queuecommand, a shadow scsi_done, a write to the host template, abuse of
    SCp->Message and SCp->Status, a use of kmap_atomic() and sniffing the
    results of INQUIRY.
