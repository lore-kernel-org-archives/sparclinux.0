I really want to start with the static function model
and see if we need the dynamic function implementation.

Here is an idea for the migration path in case
we need to do that in the future.



Currently, every time user input is given,
sym_clear_all_valid() is called.

It is not efficient to blindly re-evaluate expensive $(shell ...)


So, have a list of symbols the function depends on
in its arguments.

For example,

config CC_HAS_SANE_STACKPROTECTOR
        def_bool $(shell $srctree/scripts/gcc-has-stack-protector.sh
$CC $(1), CFLAGS_BASE)


Here the first argument
  $srctree/scripts/gcc-x86-has-stack-protector.sh $CC $(1)

is the shell command.
$(1), $(2), ... will be replaced with the values of symbols (or expressions)
that follow when running the shell command.


The second argument
CFLAGS_BASE
is the dependency symbol (or expression).


CFLAGS_BASE can be dynamically changed like

config CFLAGS_BASE
        string
        default "-m64" if 64BIT
        default "-m32"


When and only when CFLAGS_BASE is updated, the function should be re-calculated.
(This will require efforts to minimize the amount of re-evaluation.)




cc-option will be implemented like follows:

macro cc-option $(shell $CC -Werror $$(1) $(1) -c -x c /dev/null -o
/dev/null, CFLAGS_BASE)



Please notice the difference between $$(1) and $(1).

$(1) is immediately expanded by cc-option macro.

$$(1) is escaped since we want to expand it by $(shell ...), not by
$(cc-option ...)



For example,

  $(cc-option -fstack-protector)

will be expanded to

  $(shell gcc -Werror $(1) -fstack-protector -c -x c /dev/null -o
/dev/null, CFLAGS_BASE)

Since macros are just textual shorthand, so this expansion happens
during the parse phase.



Then, the evaluation phase does the following every time CFLAGS_BASE is updated.

gcc -Werror [value of CFLAGS_BASE] -fstack-protector -c -x c /dev/null
-o /dev/null


This is a new form of expression, so it will be managed in AST tree
with a flag E_SHELL (or E_FUNC) etc.


Not implemented at all.  Just a rough sketch.
