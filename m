Oh yes, alignments are so much fun! (for some definitions of fun) ;)

The problem with these alignments is that they are just a hint to gcc, telling
it what the minimum alignment of a type should be. gcc is free to align on a
larger boundary if it wants to.

But the following test program is very instructive:

#include <stdio.h>

struct test {
        void *a;
        void *b;
        void *c;
        void *d;
        void *e;
        void *f;
        void *g;
        void *h;
        void *i;
        void *j;
        void *k;
        void *l;
        void *m;
        void *n;
        void *o;
        void *p;
        void *q;
};

int main()
{
        struct test __attribute__((aligned(4))) v;
        printf("%d\n", __alignof__(v));
        return 0;
}

(on x86_64, with gcc 4.5.1 and gcc 4.4.4)

if we put the "__attribute__((aligned(4)))" at the v definition (variable
attribute), the program returns an alignment of 4. If we move it after struct
test declaration (type attribute), the program returns an alignment of 8 (thus
taking the max between the attribute alignment and the largest field).

But that's a real problem, because in include/trace/ftrace.h, we have an
alignment of 4 forced on the definition, but there is a mismatch with
trace_events.c:

extern struct ftrace_event_call __start_ftrace_events[];
extern struct ftrace_event_call __stop_ftrace_events[];

for which the alignment attribute is missing (so an alignment of 8 will be
used there).

So it all worked as long as the size of struct ftrace_event_call was a multiple
of 8 bytes (struct ftrace_event_call constains 2 integers if we exclude the perf
fields), but the new fields added by perf contain a supplementary 4-byte
integer, which seems to be causing the breakage: the structures are appended one
next to another when defined, but the iteration on these structures thinks they
are 8-byte aligned.

Steven, what were you trying to fix in the first place when you added the
aligned(4) to the definition ? It might have just been that the _ftrace_events
section needed to be aligned on at least 8 bytes in the linker scripts, but was
only aligned on 4-bytes. Forcing the definition alignment down to 4 possibly
fixed the problem you experienced on x86_64, but seems to be causing other
problems.

I would recommend to:

- Keep the linker script _ftrace_events alignment as it is now (aligned on 32
  bytes).
- Remove the aligned(4) attributes from all struct ftrace_event_call
  definitions.

And see how this works. The only problem that might come up is if gcc decides to
align struct ftrace_event_call (which is about 136 bytes in size) on an
alignment larger than 32 bytes, which would be really surprising.
