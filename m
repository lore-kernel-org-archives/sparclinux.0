The patch is just optimization. The patch does not fix a problems.
As you know, the function may be called many times for the same page.
I think if a page is sets to page_type and Page Private flag and page->private,
the page need not be set the same things again. So we check page_type when
get_page_bootmem() is called. And if the page has been set to them, the page
is only incremented page->_count.
