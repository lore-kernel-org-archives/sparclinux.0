Hi Michal,

Yes, I've thought about it, and coccinelle falls a bit short (it's not smart
enough to know which put_page()'s to convert). However, there is a debug
option planned: a yet-to-be-posted commit [1] uses struct page extensions
(obviously protected by CONFIG_DEBUG_GET_USER_PAGES_REFERENCES) to add
a redundant counter. That allows:

void __put_page(struct page *page)
{
	...
	/* Someone called put_page() instead of put_user_page() */
	WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&page_ext->pin_count) > 0);

The debug option above is still a bit simplistic in its implementation (and maybe
not taking full advantage of the data it has), but I think it's preferable,
because it monitors the "core" and WARNs.

Instead of the wrapper, I'm thinking: documentation and the passage of time,
plus the debug option (perhaps enhanced--probably once I post it someone will
notice opportunities), yes?

Yes, there are quite a few places that don't involve _bvec, as we can see
right here. So we need something. Andrew asked for a debug option some time
ago, and several people (Dave Hansen, Dan Williams, Jerome) had the idea
of vmap-ing gup pages separately, so you can definitely tell where each
page came from. I'm hoping not to have to go to that level of complexity
though.
