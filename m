  I'm helpless here. I don't see how we can miss a wakeup (plus you seem to
be the only one reporting the bug). Could you please compile and test the k=
ernel
with the attached patch? It will print to kernel log when we go to sleep
waiting for inode commit and when we send wakeups etc. When you hit the
deadlock, please send me your kernel log. It should help with debugging why=
 do
we miss the wakeup. Thanks.
