This was just an example. We have others. khugepaged which tries to
create THP in the background or proc per pid files handlers might hold
the lock while allocating and who knows what else.

Many places which are holding mmap_sem are sleepable right (e.g. doing
GFP_KERNEL allocation) now and I am not really sure we can change all of
them to not be.

I guess we are talking past each other. What I meant was that while
all syscalls are allowed to not return to the userspace because the
task might get killed but not all of them accept to get interrupted by
a signal and return with EINTR. None of the man page of mmap, mremap,
mlock, mprotect list EINTR as a possibility so I would be really afraid
of returning an unexpected error code.

I have mimicked an API which we already have for mutex. Sure it is not
used much yet but I guess other callsites might benefit from using it
as well. I haven't explored that because I am trying to focus on the
OOM problem currently. I have tried hard to not complicate the core
locking code just because of the new API. If you have any concerns there
I am willing to look at it.

Seeing OOM livelocks resp. deadlocks is not something unseen. We
have seen some reports in the past. The matter of fact is that it
is easy for an unprivileged user to lock up the system completely
currently (OOM killer tries to kill a task which is blocked on a
lock - e.g. i_mutex - which is held by another process which loops
inside the memory allocator). This issue has been discussed a lot
recently (e.g. LWN coverage of the discussion at LSFMM last year
https://lwn.net/Articles/627419/). That is the reason why I am trying to
make the OOM handling more reliable (by introducing a reliable async oom
reclaim aka oom_reaper_) and that sounds like a sufficient justification
to me.

Does this make more sense now?

Yeah, I have understood your suggestion and I see it as a more generic
approach as well but my counter argument was that some syscalls might be
unexpected to return EINTR. My quick check of memory management syscalls
shown that EINTR is not described as a potential error code. Or am I
missing something here and you are suggesting ERESTARTNOINTR return path
from down_write_interruptible?
