The .config is the canonical format everyone is used to.

It also has advantages like a defined order of the options.

And it is actually an advantage that you see what the other options are 
set to (e.g. in this case your miniconfig did not show the value of 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG which was the most important option for understanding the 
bug) - it doesn't matter whether you {dis,en}abled it intentionally, 
all that matter is it's value.

There might be use cases where a miniconfig is better, but for debugging 
compile errors a full .config is much better.
