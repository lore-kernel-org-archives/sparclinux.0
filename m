I think I prefer to have both LEGACY_TIME_SYSCALLS to guard
the native deprecated syscalls (disabled on 32-bit architectures after
the conversion, and enabled on 64-bit architectures until
we merge the next one), and COMPAT_32BIT_TIME to guard the
compat versions of both the deprecated and the non-deprecated
syscalls (enabled on all existing 32-bit architectures after the
conversion, and on 64-bit architectures if they provide a compat
mode for the former).

Those two are not symmetric, but I think those are the most
common combinations, and the Kconfig symbol helps document
what they are.

There is one more category for things like io_getevents() and
rt_sigtimedwait that also need two separate compat versions,
one for 32-bit time_t and one for 64-bit time_t, but it seems better
to deal with those case-by-case rather than introducing another
Kconfig symbol.
