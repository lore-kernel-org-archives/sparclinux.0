David Howells also asked about this. I think having a common table will
be best in the long run, patches welcome.

As you noticed, there are still a few minor differences between the files
on mips, arm, x86, alpha and s390, and we are missing the .tbl files
for arm-compat and asm-generic, as well as an architecture independent
script.

Once that is all taken care of, we can move the entries for syscall
403 and higher into a common file, and change the script to pick
up the contents from there in addition to the architecture specific
file.
