Does it make that much of a difference?

You said:

Patch 1 still touches five architectures.
Patches 3-7 still have the potential to break an architecture, but only one of
them at a time.

From a bisectability point of view there's no change.
Except that patch 1 (and 8) may break something, too ;-)
