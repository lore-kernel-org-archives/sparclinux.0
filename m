From an API yes.

DAX checks for VMA's being Filesystem DAX.  Therefore, it requires collection
of VMA's as the GUP code executes.  The unlocked version can drop the lock and
therefore the VMAs may become invalid.  Therefore, the 2 code paths are
incompatible.

Users of GUP unlocked are going to want the benefit of FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY.
So I don't anticipate anyone using FOLL_LONGTERM with
get_user_pages_unlocked().

FWIW this thread is making me think my original patch which simply implemented
get_user_pages_fast_longterm() would be more clear.  There is some evidence
that the GUP API was trending that way (see get_user_pages_remote).  That seems
wrong but I don't know how to ensure users don't specify the wrong flag.

Code comment would be necessary, sure.  Was just throwing ideas out there.
