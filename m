I'm curious what those security vulnerabilities would be. The standard
issue with close-on-exec failure (e.g. races) is the leaking of
arbitrary file descriptors (typically, ones opened by other threads or
other unrelated portions of the program) to resources the new process
should not have. "Leaking" of an inode-reference-only (no permissions)
O_PATH fd or pseudo-fd to the script that's to be run does not seem
like a vulnerability to me, and it would only be "leaked" if the
interpreter does something unexpected.

0 is obviously not a candidate; it's stdin. 255 is also not a
candidate though. Consider for example something like irssi's /upgrade
that's going to have the child inheriting an arbitrary set of file
descriptors that need to keep their original numbers, possibly
including 255. Imposing a script in between should not cause arbitrary
file descriptors to be lost.

I'm not proposing code because I'm a libc developer not a kernel
developer. I know what's needed for userspace to provide a conforming
fexecve to applications, not how to implement that on the kernel side,
although I'm trying to provide constructive ideas. The hostility is
really not necessary.
