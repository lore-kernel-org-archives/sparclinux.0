From your explanation, it looks like what I said *was* right...what I was
missing was the fact that VM_LOCKED isn't set in the first place.  So that
call would be a no-op, clearing a flag that's already cleared.

One other question...if I call mlock2(MLOCK_ONFAULT) on a range that
already has resident pages, I believe that those pages will not be locked
until they are reclaimed and faulted back in again, right?  I suspect that
could be surprising to users.

Thanks,
