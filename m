Don't worry about my mmotm git tree. I will either cherry-pick these
patches from the tip or if Ingo can base them on 4.5 then I can pull
from his branch.

I was more worried about dependencies when you send your patch bomb to
Linus because then it is an additional burden on you to watch for tip
merge before you send yours.

Thanks!
