There's another, less likely, possibility.  It made the allocation
table much larger and the lowest address used ended up lower.
0x0000007fc8fa40 vs 0x0000007fc94000.  Not too much of difference and
just allocating some more memory should rule out or confirm it.

Yeah, redzonning can definitely help but I'm not sure whether we want
to go full on allocation debugging and all for early allocator.  The
thing doesn't even support freeing.

I suspect the size modification was added later to avoid expanding
allocation table early during boot and we can do that only for
memblock_alloc*() calls as they don't have matching free interface.
If we modify explicit reservations, we have to propagate the modified
size to each user and so on.  Given that the allocation table is
discarded after boot completion and there aren't too many explicit
reservations, I don't think we need to expand size aligning to all
find_in_range users.  I guess it all depends on how complete allocator
we want for early boot.

Thanks.
