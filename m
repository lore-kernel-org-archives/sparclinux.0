Sure, I can make nd_jump_link() give -ELOOP and drop the current need
for LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED -- if necessary we can re-add it for the
magic-link reopening patches.

I was referring to [1] which has been dropped from this series. I
misspoke -- you don't need the full open_flags, you just need acc_mode
in nameidata -- but from memory you (understandably) weren't in favour
of that either because it further muddled the open semantics with namei.

So the solution I went with was to stash away the i_mode of the
magiclink in nd->last_magiclink.mode (though to avoid a race which Jann
found, you actually need to recalculate it when you call nd_jump_link()
but that's a different topic) and then check it in trailing_magiclink().

However, I've since figured out that we need to restrict things like
bind-mounts and truncate() because they can be used to get around the
restrictions. I dropped that patch from this series so that I could work
on implementing the restrictions for the other relevant VFS syscalls
separately from openat2 (upgrade_mask will be re-added to open_how with
those patches).

My point was that AFAICS we will either have to have nd->acc_mode (or
something similar) or have nd->last_magiclink in order to implement the
magic-link reopening hardening.
