True, with only 16 possible tag values (actually only 14 since 0 and 15 
are reserved values), it is entirely possible to brute force the ADI 
tag. ADI is just another tool one can use to mitigate attacks. A process 
that accesses an ADI enabled memory with invalid tag gets a SIGBUS and 
is terminated. This can trigger alerts on the system and system policies 
could block the next attack. If a daemon is compromised and is forced to 
hand out data from memory it should not be reading (similar to 
heartbleed bug). the daemon itself is terminated with SIGBUS which 
should be enough to alert system admins. A rotating set of tags would 
reduce the risk from brute force attacks. Tags are set on cacheline 
(which is 64 bytes on M7). A single regular sized page can have 128 sets 
of tags. Allowing for 14 possible values for each set, that is a lot of 
possible combinations of tags making it very hard to brute force tags 
for more than a cacheline at a time. There are probably other better 
ways to make the tags harder to crack.

Shared data may not always be backed by a file. My understanding is one 
of the use cases is for in-memory databases. This shared space could 
also be used to hand off transactions in flight to other processes. 
These transactions in flight would not be backed by a file. Some of 
these use cases might not use shmfs even. Setting ADI bits at virtual 
address level catches all these cases since what backs the tagged 
virtual address can be anything - a mapped file, mmio space, just plain 
chunk of memory.

For two processes to share a page, their VMAs have to be identical as I 
understand it. If one process has TTE.mcd set (which means vma->vm_flags 
is different) while the other does not, they do not share a page.
