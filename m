Yeah, the reasoning was that it's because we're out of RCU lookup and if
we didn't re-grab ->m_seq we'd hit path_is_under() on every subsequent
".." (even though we've checked that it's safe). But yes, I should've
used a different field to avoid confusion (and stop it looking
unnecessarily dodgy). I will fix that.

Ack, will do.

The reason for doing the concurrent-{rename,mount} checks was to try to
avoid the O(n^2) in most cases, but you're right that if you have an
attacker that is spamming renames (or you're on a box with a lot of
renames and/or mounts going on *anywhere*) you will hit an O(n^2) here
(more pedantically, O(m*n) but who's counting?).

Unfortunately, I'm not sure what the best solution would be for this
one. If -EAGAIN retries are on the table, we could limit how many times
we're willing to do path_is_under() and then just return -EAGAIN.

Hinting to userspace to do a retry (with -EAGAIN as you mention in your
other mail) wouldn't be a bad thing at all, though you'd almost
certainly get quite a few spurious -EAGAINs -- &{mount,rename}_lock are
global for the entire machine, after all.

But if the only significant roadblock is that (3) seems a bit too hairy,
I would be quite happy with landing (2) as a first step (with -EAGAIN).
