When you say that the system still works, I assume that means that
writes to root file system (or what ever file system syslog was trying
to log to, typically /var/log) are still succeeding?

These messages are soft lockup messages, and doesn't necessarily means
that the system was locked up forever:

It could just mean that a "sync" command took longer than two minutes
to complete.

Without any more details about the system, its workload, whether or
not the system really was hung forever, or it was functioning normally
when you discovered it, it's hard to really say much else given the
lack of information in your e-mail.

Also note that this stack trace has nothing to do with the e-mail
thread from last August which you replied to.  At first I thought
there was a connection, which confused me as I tried to look at the
very small amount of information in your bug report.

Cheers,
