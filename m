How is it an error to call mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_ONFAULT)? How else 
would you apply mlock2(MCL_ONFAULT) to all current mappings? Later below 
you use the same example and I don't think it's different by removing 
MLOCK_LOCKED flag.

Yup that's what I was trying to suggest.

Sorry :) You could also wait a bit for more input than just from me...
