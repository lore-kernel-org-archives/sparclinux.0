Thanks for the review! I understand that tip/locking would be the most
appropriate place but I am wondering whether this causes some issues
with the follow up patches which use this new API and which I expect to
go via Andrew's tree.

That being said I do not care much but then we have a potential
dependency between mmotm and tip/locking.
